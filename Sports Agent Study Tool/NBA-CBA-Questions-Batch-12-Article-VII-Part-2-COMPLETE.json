  "questions": [
    {"id": 371, "question": "What is the basic salary matching rule for teams over the cap making trades?", "options": ["Must match within $100K", "Must match salaries within 125% + $100K or 100% based on total", "No matching required", "Must be exactly equal"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Teams over the cap must match within specific thresholds: 125% + $100K for smaller trades, or within defined bands for larger trades.", "category": "advanced-cap", "difficulty": "hard", "source": "Article VII, Section 6(c)(3)"},

    {"id": 373, "question": "For teams over the cap trading salaries between $6.5M-$19.6M, what's the matching requirement?", "options": ["100% match", "Incoming salary cannot exceed outgoing by more than $5 million", "125% of outgoing", "No limit"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "For this salary range, teams can take back the outgoing salary plus $5 million.
