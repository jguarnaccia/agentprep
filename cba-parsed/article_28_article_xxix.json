Player Ownership in Independent WNBA Teams.\n(a) Subject to Section 13(b) below and also subject to WNBA approval\nin each case, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article XIII,\nSection 2(c), an NBA player may invest in a WNBA Team in which no Team\nOwner (or family member of a Team Owner) has a direct or indirect\nbeneficial ownership interest (each such team, an “Independent WNBA\n444\nArticle XXIX\nTeam”) on substantially similar terms to other third-party investors, subject\nto the following conditions and limitations:\n(i)\nAn NBA player’s ownership interest in an Independent\nWNBA Team may not, at any time, exceed four percent\n(4%) of such Independent WNBA Team;\n(ii)\nNBA players may not in the aggregate hold more than an\neight percent (8%) ownership interest in any Independent\nWNBA Team;\n(iii)\nAn NBA player may hold an ownership interest in only\none (1) Independent WNBA Team at any one time;\n(iv)\nAny NBA player investing in an Independent WNBA Team\nshall be subject to WNBA restrictions, rules, and penalties,\nas imposed and enforced by the WNBA, applicable to other\nWNBA team owners (e.g., relating to tampering, public\ncomments on collectively bargained matters, and penalties\nfor misconduct);\n(v)\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (iv) above, an NBA player\nshall be prohibited from holding any governance rights or\nroles with respect to an Independent WNBA Team in which\nhe holds an ownership interest or with respect to the\nWNBA, including participation on WNBA team or WNBA\nleague governing bodies;\n(vi)\nNBA players’ receipt of information with respect to the\nIndependent WNBA Team and the WNBA shall be limited\nto annual audited team financials and any required tax\ninformation;\n(vii)\nAn NBA player may be required by the NBA to divest or\nreduce his ownership interest in an Independent WNBA\nTeam if any of the conditions set forth in subparagraphs\n(i)-(vi) above cease to be met; and\n(viii) In the event an Independent WNBA Team in which an\nNBA player is invested proposes to sell a “controlling\nownership interest” to a Team Owner (or family member of\nArticle XXIX\n445\na Team Owner), any NBA player investor in such\nIndependent WNBA Team will be required to dispose of its\nentire ownership interest in such Independent WNBA\nTeam, including through the exercise of any tag-along or\ndrag-along rights applicable to such ownership interest. For\npurposes of this Section 13, a “controlling ownership\ninterest” means a majority of the voting or equity interests\nin, or contractual control of, the Independent WNBA Team.\nIf the Independent WNBA Team’s existing governing\nagreements do not contain provisions with such rights, then\nsuch agreements shall be amended in connection with an\nNBA player’s investment to create customary tag-along or\ndrag-along rights with respect to the player’s interests, and\nsuch amendment shall be a condition to such NBA player’s\ninvestment. For clarity, in the event an Independent WNBA\nTeam in which an NBA player is invested proposes to sell\nless than a controlling ownership interest to a Team Owner\n(or a family member of a Team Owner), such proposed\ntransaction will not be in compliance with Section 13(a)(1)\nabove unless such NBA player disposes of his entire\nownership interest in such Independent WNBA Team by\nselling to a person or entity that is not a Team Owner (or a\nfamily member of a Team Owner), prior to such proposed\nsale.\n(b) NBA player investment in Independent WNBA Teams shall be\nsubject to compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to\nsecurities laws and federal labor law. If, at any point, any player investment\nor provision of this Section 13 does not comply with applicable laws, then\nthe player shall use best efforts to, and cause the Independent WNBA Team\nto, modify the terms of such investment and/or the parties will negotiate in\ngood faith to modify the terms of this Section 13, in each case, to the extent\nnecessary to fully comply with law and, if such modifications are not or\ncannot be negotiated, then (i) the applicable player investment shall be\ndivested in full and (ii) the applicable terms of this Section 13 shall be\nrendered void and of no further force and effect.\n(c) For purposes of this Section 13, a “player” shall include any person\nor entity controlled by, related to, or acting with authority on behalf of a\nplayer. For clarity, and notwithstanding anything to contrary in this\n446\nArticle XXIX\nSection 13, no agent or representative of a player may invest in a WNBA\nteam.\nSection 14. Nondisclosure.\nThe parties agree that (a) the economic terms of any individual Uniform\nPlayer Contract entered into by a Team and a player, and (b) any information\ncontained in, or disclosed to the Players Association in connection with an\nAudit Report, Draft Audit Report, Interim Audit Report, Interim\nDesignated Share Audit Report, or BRI Report, shall not be disclosed to the\nmedia by (i) the NBA, its Teams, or their respective employees, or (ii) the\nPlayers Association, NBA players, or their respective employees, agents, or\nrepresentatives.\nSection 15.

Additional Canadian Provisions.\n(a) The bases upon which a player may be disciplined or discharged or\na Player Contract terminated, as set forth in this Agreement and/or in the\nUniform Player Contract, shall constitute just and reasonable cause within\nthe meaning of any applicable Canadian law or statute (federal or provincial)\nand, to the extent this Agreement or the Uniform Player Contract provides\nspecific penalties for such conduct, those penalties shall apply.\n(b) During the term of this Agreement, the NBA and Players\nAssociation shall consult regularly about issues relating to the workplace\nwhich affect the parties or any player bound by this Agreement.\n(c) If and to the extent Sections 48 and 49 of the Ontario Labour\nRelations Act are or may be found applicable to this Agreement, the parties\nagree that the provisions thereof shall apply only to disputes between the\nToronto Raptors and players for the Toronto Raptors. Furthermore, the\nArticle XXIX\n447\nparties agree and acknowledge that any termination and severance benefits\nprovided to players pursuant to this Agreement (including the provisions of\nPlayer Contracts that provide, in certain circumstances, for the continued\npayment of Salary to a player following the termination of a Player Contract)\nconstitute and/or shall be deemed to constitute a greater right or benefit to\nthe Player pursuant to Section 5(2) of the Employment Standards Act, 2000\n(Ontario) and the provisions of Sections 54-66 of such Act do not apply.\n(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that a player employed by an\nNBA Team pursuant to the provisions of a Uniform Player Contract, a\n10-Day Contract, a Rest-of-Season Contract, or a Two-Way Contract is\nand/or shall be deemed to be an “employee hired on the basis that his\nemployment is to terminate on the expiry of a definite term or the\ncompletion of a specific task” within the meaning of paragraph 1 of\nSection 2(1) of Ontario Regulation 288/01 under the Ontario Employment\nStandards Act, 2000, so as to render inapplicable to NBA players the\nprovisions of Sections 54-62 of such Act.\n(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the severance benefits\nprovided to players pursuant to this Agreement (including the provisions of\nPlayer Contracts that provide, in certain circumstances, for the continued\npayment of Salary to a player following the termination of a Player Contract)\nconstitute and/or shall be deemed to constitute a settlement binding on the\nplayer within the meaning of Section 6 of the Ontario Employment\nStandards Act, 2000, and/or “an amount paid to an employee for loss of\nemployment under a provision of an employment contract based upon\nlength of employment, length of service or seniority” within the meaning of\nparagraph 2 of Section 65(8) of the Ontario Employment Standards Act,\n2000, so as to render inapplicable to NBA players the provisions of\nSections 63-66 of such Act.\n(f) Upon the NBA’s request, the Players Association shall cooperate\nwith the NBA in a reasonable manner in connection with any effort the\nNBA may make to seek an exemption from any Canadian (federal or\nprovincial) law or regulation affecting the employment relationship that is\ninconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement\nbetween the Players Association and the NBA (or NBA Properties) or\nbetween any player and any NBA Team.\n448\nArticle XXIX\n(g) All players employed by NBA Teams shall be paid in U.S. dollars,\nregardless of where such Teams are located.\nSection 17.
