Thus, for\nexample, a Team could not provide for fifty percent (50%) Base\nCompensation protection in the first Season of a Player Contract and one\nhundred percent (100%) Base Compensation protection in the second\nSeason of the Contract. However, the foregoing rule does not prevent a\nTeam from providing a percentage of Base Compensation protection in a\nfuture Season that is higher than in a prior Season if the higher level of Base\nCompensation for the future Season is conditional and the condition cannot\nbe satisfied until the completion of the prior Season. For example, it is\nArticle II\n29\npermissible for a Contract to provide that Base Compensation protection\nfor the first Season of a Player Contract equals fifty percent (50%) and Base\nCompensation protection for the second Season will be increased from fifty\npercent (50%) to one hundred percent (100%) if the player is on the Team’s\nroster as of the August 1 prior to the second Season of the Player Contract.\n(j) With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or after\nthe effective date of this Agreement:\n(i)\nThe maximum amount of aggregate Base Compensation\nthat can be protected for death is thirty million dollars\n($30,000,000); and\n(ii)\nIf a player (other than a player signed to a Contract that\nprovides in any Season for the player to earn Compensation\nequal to his applicable Minimum Player Salary that (x) is\nsigned after the first day of the Regular Season, or (y) does\nnot provide for full Base Compensation protection for lack\nof skill and injury or illness for the first Season of such\nContract) elects to purchase term life insurance for his\nbenefit, his Team shall be permitted to reimburse him each\nSeason for the premiums paid for such insurance with\nrespect to such Season and any other future Season(s);\nprovided, however, that:\n(A)\nThe amount of coverage for which premiums are\nreimbursed by the Team in any Season shall not\nexceed the lesser of (x) the aggregate amount of the\nplayer’s unearned Base Compensation for such\nSeason and each remaining Season (excluding an\nOption Year if not yet exercised) that is not\nprotected for death, and (y) the difference between\n(i) eighty-five million dollars ($85,000,000) and\n(ii) the aggregate amount of the player’s unearned\nBase Compensation for such Season and each\nremaining Season (excluding an Option Year if not\nyet exercised) that is protected for death.\n30\nArticle II\n(B)\n(iii)\nAny such premium reimbursement shall not exceed\nthe cost for ten-year guaranteed term coverage at\npreferred rates.\nIf a Contract contains death protection covering ten million\ndollars ($10,000,000) or more of Base Compensation, the\nplayer shall be precluded from purchasing life insurance for\na period of ninety (90) days following the execution or\nextension (as applicable) of the Contract or until such earlier\ntime as the Team notifies the player in writing that it is no\nlonger attempting to purchase life insurance coverage on the\nplayer (up to the amount of the player’s Base Compensation\nprotection for death) for the Team’s benefit. During such\nninety (90) day period or until such time as the Team issues\nthe foregoing written notification to the player, the Team’s\nefforts to purchase life insurance on the player for the\nTeam’s benefit shall be conducted diligently and in good\nfaith.\n(k) With respect to Player Contracts entered into or extended on or after\nthe effective date of this Agreement, in the event that a Team terminates a\nPlayer Contract (resulting in the player’s separation of service from the\nTeam), and the Team is obligated thereafter to make payments to the player\npursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract, such payments shall be made in\naccordance with the following schedule:\n(i)\nIf, as of the date of the player’s separation from service, the\naggregate Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant\nto Exhibit 2 of the Contract is five hundred thousand dollars\n($500,000) or less, such amount shall be paid in accordance\nwith the semi-monthly installments prescribed by the\npayment schedule set forth in the Contract. Each\ninstallment shall equal the amount of Base Compensation\nthat was due per pay period for the applicable Season\nimmediately before the Player’s separation until the\naggregate amount of the remaining Base Compensation\nowed to the player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract is\npaid in full.\nArticle II\n(ii)\n31\nIf, as of the date of the player’s separation from service, the\naggregate Base Compensation owed to the player pursuant\nto Exhibit 2 of the Contract exceeds five hundred thousand\ndollars ($500,000), such amount shall be paid as follows:\n(x)\nThe Base Compensation, if any, owed to the player\npursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract with respect\nto the “current season” (as defined below) at the\ntime when the request for waivers on the player is\nmade shall be paid in accordance with the payment\nschedule set forth in the Contract. Each installment\nshall equal the amount of Base Compensation that\nwas due per pay period immediately before the\nplayer’s separation until the aggregate amount of the\nremaining Base Compensation owed to the player\npursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract with respect\nto the current season is paid in full. For purposes of\nthis subparagraph (x) and subparagraph (y) below\nonly, the “current season” means the period from\nSeptember 1 through June 30.\n(y)\nThe remaining Base Compensation, if any, owed to\nthe player pursuant to Exhibit 2 of the Contract shall\nbe aggregated and paid in equal amounts per year\nover a period equal to twice the number of NBA\nSeasons (including any Season covered by a Player\nOption Year) remaining on this Contract following\nthe date upon which the request for waivers\noccurred, plus one NBA Season. For this purpose,\nif the request for waivers is made during the period\nfrom September 1 through June 30, the number of\nNBA Seasons remaining on this Contract shall not\ninclude the current season (as defined in\nsubparagraph (x) above). The rescheduled payments\ndescribed above shall be paid over the applicable\nnumber of NBA Seasons in equal semi-monthly\ninstallments on the pay dates prescribed by\nParagraph 3(a) of the Uniform Player Contract.\n32\nArticle II\nThe following example is for clarity. A player has four (4) Seasons remaining\non his Contract with protected Base Compensation of the following\namounts: $4 million in Season 1, $4.3 million in Season 2, $4.7 million in\nSeason 3, and $5 million in Season 4. The player is waived on December 1\nof Season 1. Under Section 4(k)(ii)(x) above, the player would receive the\nremainder of his $4 million in Base Compensation for Season 1 in\naccordance with the payment schedule set forth in his Contract. Under\nSection 4(k)(ii)(y) above, the $14 million of protected Base Compensation\nremaining to be paid for Seasons 2-4 of the Contract would be paid at a rate\nof $2 million per Season for the next seven (7) Seasons in accordance with\nthe payment schedule set forth in Paragraph 3 of the Contract. If the same\nplayer is instead waived on July 30 prior to Season 1, the $18 million of\nprotected Base Compensation remaining to be paid for Seasons 1-4 of the\nContract would be paid – under Section 4(k)(ii) above – at a rate of\n$2 million per Season for the next nine (9) Seasons in accordance with the\npayment schedule set forth in Paragraph 3 of the Contract.\n(l) In addition to the standard conditions or limitations set forth above\nin this Section 4 (as set forth in the form of Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player\nContract), a Team and a player are authorized under Article II,\nSections 4(a)-(e) to negotiate additional conditions or limitations applicable\nto the player’s Compensation protection for such categories as the Team\nand player agree to protect that relate to only the following: (i) whether the\nTeam waives a player by a certain time (e.g., providing that a player’s Base\nCompensation protection increases if the Team does not request waivers on\nthe player by a certain date); (ii) achievement of certain benchmarks relating\nto Team and/or player performance or a player’s physical condition\n(e.g., providing that a player’s Base Compensation protection increases if the\nplayer achieves certain performance criteria or meets specified weigh-in\ncriteria), provided that any such performance benchmarks must be based\nsolely upon official NBA statistics, the determination of whether a player\nhas met any such performance benchmark shall be made solely by reference\nto official NBA statistics as published on NBA.com, and any amendment\nagreed upon pursuant to this subsection is structured so as to provide an\nincentive for positive achievement by the Team and/or the player; (iii) a\nplayer experiencing a particular injury, illness, or other medical condition\n(e.g., providing that a player’s Base Compensation protection does not apply\nif the Team terminates a Contract due to a particular injury to a player’s left\nknee); and (iv) the Team’s ability to obtain insurance, using best efforts, of\na certain type and dollar amount within a specified period of time following\nArticle II\n33\nexecution or extension (as applicable) of the Contract. Other than the\nstandard conditions or limitations set forth above in this Section 4 (as set\nforth in the form of Exhibit 2 to the Uniform Player Contract) and any\nindividually-negotiated conditions or limitations in accordance with this\nSection (l), no Player Contract entered into or extended on or after the\neffective date of this Agreement (but in the case of Extensions only with\nrespect to the extended term) may contain any additional condition or\nlimitation of any kind on a player’s Compensation protection."

In the case of a Rookie Scale\nExtension entered into pursuant to (ii) or (iii) above, the player and Team\n42\nArticle II\nmay instead provide that Salaries in any Seasons after the first Season of the\nextended term will be increased or decreased by a different percentage based\non the percentage of the Salary Cap that the player receives in Salary in the\nfirst Season of the extended term. Any such Rookie Scale Extension shall\nbe deemed amended on July 1 of the Salary Cap Year covering the first\nSeason of the extended term to provide for specific Salaries for each Season\nof the extended term, based on the Maximum Annual Salary applicable to\nsuch player on such July 1. A Rookie Scale Extension entered into pursuant\nto this subsection may not include any Incentive Compensation.\n(e) A player and a Team may provide in a Designated Veteran Player\nExtension that the player’s Salary (in the first Season of the extended term)\nwill equal “[_____]% of the Salary Cap in effect during the first Season of\nthe extended term.” The percentage to be included where brackets are\nindicated in the foregoing language shall equal the percentage that is agreed\nupon by the Team and player, which percentage shall in no event be less\nthan thirty percent (30%) or greater than thirty-five percent (35%).

If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the\nPlayers Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative\narrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create\nany right: (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this\nAgreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits\nto the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.\n(e) Administration.\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.3(f) of the Pension Trust\nAgreement, which are hereby incorporated by reference and\nexpressly designed to survive the expiration or termination of this\nAgreement, the Pension Plan shall continue to be jointly operated\nand administered by the NBA and the Players Association in\naccordance with Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management\nRelations Act of 1947, as amended, and the provisions of the\nPension Trust Agreement and the Pension Plan.\n(2) It is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that:\n(i) the Pension Plan shall continue to constitute a\ncollectively-bargained multiemployer defined benefit pension plan\n74\nArticle IV\nthat is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; and (ii) the\nPension Plan’s corresponding Trust is exempt from taxation under\nthe provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code.\n(3) The daily operations of the Pension Plan shall continue to be\ndelegated to one or more independent third-party administrators, as\nselected by the Board of Trustees of the Pension Plan in its sole\ndiscretion.\n(f) Contributions/Funding. The NBA and Players Association\nacknowledge and agree that the Teams shall continue at all times to\ncontribute to the Plan at least the amount necessary to meet the Pension\nPlan’s statutory minimum funding requirements under Section 412,\nSection 431, and, if applicable, Section 432 of the Code, or any other\napplicable law (the “Minimum Funding Standards”) for such Plan Year, as\ndetermined by the actuaries of the Pension Plan. For any period during the\nterm of this Agreement during which a new “funding improvement plan” (a\n“FIP”) is required to be adopted by the Pension Plan under the Minimum\nFunding Standards, the funding benchmark for such FIP shall equal the\nfunding benchmark required by the Minimum Funding Standards. The\nTeams may, in the sole discretion of the NBA, contribute to the Pension\nPlan more than the amount necessary to meet the Minimum Funding\nStandards; provided, however, that any such additional contribution amount\nshall not be greater than the contribution amount determined by the\nactuaries of the Pension Plan in accordance with the Pension Plan’s\nhistorical scheduled contribution methodology. All contributions shall be\nconditioned on their being fully deductible by the Teams when paid.\n(g) Players Employed by Toronto.\n(1) Players employed by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment\nPartnership (or any successor thereto) (“Toronto”) or by an NBA\nTeam located in any country other than the United States shall\ncontinue to receive pension benefits of comparable value. Except\nas otherwise provided in Section 1(g)(2), players employed by\nToronto (“Toronto Players”) shall continue to receive such benefits\nby means of the Pension Plan and the Toronto Raptors Players’\nPension Plan, as restated effective February 2, 2019, and as amended\nfrom time to time (the “Toronto Plan”); provided, however, that a\nplayer shall not be eligible to participate (or continue to participate)\nArticle IV\n75\nin the Pension Plan for any period of time during which the player\nis both a resident of Canada for income tax purposes and a Toronto\nPlayer (a “Canadian Resident”) but shall instead be eligible to receive\na cash payment as described in Section 7 below.\n(2) If the participation of Toronto Players in the Pension Plan\nwould, at any time, result in the Pension Plan becoming subject to\nCanadian provincial pension legislation and/or Canadian federal\nincome tax laws (to the extent that the application of such laws\nwould result in adverse tax consequences to the Pension Plan, the\nNBA Teams or the Toronto Players) or result in the Toronto Plan’s\nfailure, at any future time, to either be qualified under the Code or\nregistered under Canadian provincial pension legislation or\nCanadian federal tax laws, then any obligation to establish, maintain,\nor make contributions to the Pension Plan in respect of Toronto\nPlayers and the Toronto Plan pursuant to this Agreement or\npursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall\nterminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not\nimpair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this\nAgreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other\nprovision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it\ncreate any right: (i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this\nAgreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits\nto the players; (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike. In the event of such\ntermination, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in\ngood faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided\nby Toronto to the Toronto Players. Any such alternative\narrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax\nbasis) to Toronto substantially equal to but no greater than the\nannual accrual cost that Toronto would have incurred under the\nPension Plan and the Toronto Plan. If despite good faith\nnegotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with\nrespect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such\nfailure to agree shall not create any right: (A) to unilaterally\nimplement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning\nthe provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or\n(C) to strike.\n(3) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.1(a) of the Toronto Plan,\nwhich are hereby incorporated by reference and expressly designed\n76\nArticle IV\nto survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the\nToronto Plan shall continue to be jointly operated and administered\nby the NBA and Players Association in accordance with Section\n302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as\namended, Section 8(1)(b) of the Pension Benefits Act (as defined in\nthe Toronto Plan), and the provisions of the Toronto Plan.\n(4) It is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that:\n(i) the Toronto Plan shall continue to constitute a\ncollectively-bargained single employer defined benefit pension plan\nthat is sponsored by Toronto and is tax-qualified under\nSection 401(a) of the Code and registered under Section 147.1 of the\nIncome Tax Act (as defined in the Toronto Plan) and Sections 9 and\n12 of the Pension Benefits Act; and (ii) the Toronto Plan’s\ncorresponding trust fund shall continue to be exempt from taxation\nunder the provisions of Section 149(1)(o) of the Income Tax Act\nand Section 501(a) of the Code.\n(5) The daily operations of the Toronto Plan shall continue to be\ndelegated to one or more independent third-party administrators, as\nselected by the Committee of the Toronto Plan in its sole discretion.\n(h) Pension Plan Tax-Qualification Status.\nNotwithstanding\nanything else in this Agreement: (1) if any change or amendment made to\nthe Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or to any regulations (whether\nfinal, temporary, or proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any\ninterpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation,\napplication, or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the\nUnited States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law,\nor any regulations or rulings issued thereunder; (3) if any regulations\n(whether final, temporary, or proposed) or rulings issued by the IRS under\nthe Code or ERISA; or (4) if any provisions of this Agreement, including,\nwithout limitation, any of the amendments or benefit increases to be\nprovided under the Pension Plan pursuant to this Section 1, would result in\nthe Pension Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a)\nof the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above\nany costs required to be incurred to implement the provisions of this\nAgreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement in order for the\nPension Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the\nCode (but only to the extent that such additional costs are incurred in\nArticle IV\n77\nconnection with the provision of pension benefits to their non-player\nemployees or to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of\nSections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation\nto continue to provide for the accrual of additional benefits under the\nPension Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective\nbargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such\ntermination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision\nof this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision\nof any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right:\n(i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms\nconcerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout;\nor (iii) to strike. In the event of such termination, the NBA and Players\nAssociation agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative\narrangement to be provided by the NBA Teams to the players. The costs\nof any such alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined\non an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams substantially equal to but no greater\nthan the annual accrual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the\nPension Plan to fund the benefit described in this Section 1, commencing\non the date of termination. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and\nthe Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative\narrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any\nright: (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any\nterms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to\nlockout; or (C) to strike.\n(i) Additional Pension Benefits Costs. The NBA Teams shall pay\nall costs, including, without limitation, the cost of professional fees (e.g.,\nattorneys, accountants, actuaries, and consultants) (“Professional Fees”),\nincurred in connection with: (1) the operation and administration of the\nToronto Plan (but excluding the cost of contributions made by Toronto to\nthe Toronto Plan), and (2) the determination and implementation of any\nalternative benefits pursuant to Sections 1(g)(2) and/or 1(h).\n(j) Actuarial Determinations. All actuarial determinations that need\nto be made in connection with, or under, the Pension Plan, including,\nwithout limitation, those necessary to implement this Section 1 and Section\n9 below, shall be made by the actuaries of the Pension Plan. Any such\nactuarial determinations shall be binding and conclusive.\n78\nArticle IV"

The cost to Toronto of funding any alternative\narrangement(s) to any of the benefit(s) described in Section 3(a) shall be\nsubject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

For purposes of this Section 4, a\n“Contribution Year” means each November 1 through October 31\nin respect of which a Team Funding Pool (defined below) is\nprovided under this Section 4.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4(a) to the contrary,\nand subject to the requirements of the Code and IRS rules and\nregulations, if the Board of Trustees of the Post-Career Income Plan\n(the “PCIP Trustees”) determines, after Post-Career Annuities have\nbeen purchased for Eligible Players for a Contribution Year, that a\npresent or former player should have received an Allocated Share\nfor such Contribution Year but did not receive an Allocated Share,\nsuch present or former player shall be entitled to an Allocated Share\nequal to the amount of the Allocated Share made to the other\nEligible Players for such Contribution Year, which shall be used to\npurchase one or more Post-Career Annuities in the same manner\nand on the same terms as the other Eligible Players for such\nContribution Year.

(B) to lockout; or (C) to\nstrike.\n(4) If the Taxable Allocated Share attributable to Eligible Players\nwould be subject to a federal income tax rate higher than the rate\nthat would apply if the Taxable Allocated Share were paid as Base\nCompensation, then any obligation to maintain the Post-Career\nIncome Plan pursuant to this Agreement shall, at the option of the\nPlayers Association, terminate;

The annual cost to the Teams of any such\nalternative arrangement (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall\nbe substantially equal to but no greater than the annual cost that such\nTeams would have incurred under the Post-Career Income Plan on\nthe date of termination. The cost of funding of any such alternative\narrangement shall be as set forth in Section 4(d)(1). If despite good\nfaith negotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree\nwith respect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such\nfailure to agree shall not create any right (i) to unilaterally implement\nduring the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the\nprovision of post-employment benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout;\nor (iii) to strike.\n(c) Players Employed by Toronto. The terms of the Post-Career\nIncome Plan shall continue to permit participation by Toronto Players on a\ntax-effective basis under Canadian income tax laws; provided, however, that\na player shall not be eligible to participate in the Post-Career Income Plan\nfor the period of time during which the player is a Canadian Resident but\nshall instead be eligible to receive a cash payment as described in Section 7\nbelow. If the NBA and the Players Association should determine that the\nArticle IV\n93\nPost-Career Income Plan cannot continue to be provided to Toronto\nPlayers on a tax-effective basis under Canadian federal income tax laws or\nthat either the Qualified Plan or the Non-Qualified Plan would become\nsubject to Ontario’s Pension Benefits Act, the NBA and Players Association\nagree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to\nbe provided by Toronto to the Toronto Players.

If despite good faith\nnegotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect\nto an alternative arrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall\nnot create any right (1) to unilaterally implement during the term of this\nAgreement any terms concerning the provision of post-employment\nbenefits to the players; (2) to lockout; or (3) to strike.\n(d) Funding.\n(1) For each Season, except as provided below, one percent (1%)\nof BRI for such Season (the “Additional Benefit Amount”) shall be\nused to fund the Team Funding Pool (or the alternative arrangement\nreferenced in Sections 4(b)(5) and 4(c)); provided, however, that the\nAdditional Benefit Amount for a Season shall be subject to\nreduction or elimination pursuant to Article VII, Section 12(b)(1).\nIn no event shall the Additional Benefit Amount be used for any\npurpose other than as set forth in the immediately foregoing\nsentence. For purposes of all calculations called for under this\nAgreement of, or relating to, Benefits (including, without limitation,\nfor purposes of (i) preparing the Audit Report, Interim Audit\nReport, or Interim Designated Share Audit Report, and\n(ii) calculating Total Benefits, Total Salaries and Benefits, and\nProjected Benefits), the amount to be included with respect to the\nAdditional Benefit Amount shall be the full Additional Benefit\nAmount specified in this Section 4(d) and not the reduced\nAdditional Benefit Amount provided for under Article VII,\nSection 12(b)(1).\n94\nArticle IV\n(2) For each Contribution Year, all or a portion of the Additional\nBenefit Amount as determined under Section 4(d)(1) (the “Team\nFunding Pool”) shall be used to fund the Post-Career Income Plan.\n(3) The Teams shall contribute the Team Funding Pool, less Tax\nWithholding, into the Post-Career Income Plan each November\nfollowing the Contribution Year to which it relates or, if later, within\none hundred and twenty (120) days following the completion of the\nAudit Report covering the November 1 of such Contribution Year.\n(4) For each Salary Cap Year in which the amortized portion of the\namount to be included in BRI from applicable equity securities,\npursuant to Article VII, Section 1(a)(13), exceeds $5 million,\nthe NBA and the Players Association shall meet and confer to\ndiscuss in good faith the possibility of creating a funding pool equal\nto 50% of such amortized portion (the “Equity Proceeds Funding\nPool”) to fund after-tax contributions to the Non-Qualified Plan for\nplayers who were Eligible Players in any of the years during the\nperiod beginning with the Salary Cap Year in which the equity\nsecurities were received and continuing through the first Salary Cap\nYear in respect of which contributions to the Non-Qualified Plan\nare made in respect of such equity. For clarity, in the event that the\nNBA and the Players Association agree to provide the\nabove-described after-tax benefits, then, for purposes of all\ncalculations called for under this Agreement of, or relating to,\nBenefits (including, without limitation, for purposes of: (i) preparing\nthe Audit Report, Interim Audit Report, or Interim Designated\nShare Audit Report; and (ii) calculating Total Benefits, Total Salaries\nand Benefits, and Projected Benefits), the amount to be\nincluded with respect to the benefits shall be the amount of\nthe Equity Proceeds Funding Pool and not the amount of the\naggregate after-tax amounts contributed to the Non-Qualified Plan.\n(e) Additional Post-Career Income Benefits Costs. The NBA\nTeams shall pay all costs, including, without limitation, the cost of\nProfessional Fees and other administrative services provided to the\nPost-Career Income Plan (but excluding the cost of contributions made to\nthe Post-Career Income Plan) in connection with the operation and\nadministration of the Post-Career Income Plan (or any alternative\narrangement pursuant to Sections 4(b)(5) and (c)).\nArticle IV"

For purposes of this Article VII, Section 1,\nIncremental Content Expenses means, for each Salary Cap\nYear, an amount determined by the following calculation:\n(1) total deductible Team Content Expenses for that Salary\nCap Year, less (2) an amount equal to the total deductible\nTeam Content Expenses for the 2021-22 Salary Cap Year\n(i.e., $78,862,052), growing at a rate of three percent (3%)\nper Salary Cap Year, compounded.\nFor example, if Net Licensing Revenues for the 2025-26\nSalary Cap Year were $180 million, and total deductible\nTeam Content Expenses for such Salary Cap Year were\n$250 million, then the amount included in BRI in respect of\nNet Licensing Revenues would be $161.24 million, which is\nthe lesser of: (a) $180 million, and (b) $161.24 million (i.e.,\n$250 million minus $88.76 million (i.e., $78,862,052 growing\nat three percent (3%) per Salary Cap Year for four (4) Salary\nCap Years)).\n142\nArticle VII\nNet Licensing Revenues shall not include value, if any, from\ncontractual provisions (including, but not limited to, those\npreviously identified by the Players Association in\nconnection with prior BRI audits) that (x) require NBA or\nTeam licensing partners to utilize the licensing rights\npurchased from the NBA and/or Teams in licensing deals,\nor (y) impose on NBA and/or Team licensing partners\nmarketing or promotional obligations;\n(xix)\nTwenty-five percent (25%) of the gross proceeds, net of\ntwenty-five percent (25%) of Taxes, and twenty-five (25%)\nof reasonable and customary Team and Related Party\nexpenses related thereto, subject to the provisions of\nSection 1(a)(6) below, from arena plaza naming rights\nagreements with respect to arenas in which an NBA Team\nplays more than one-half of its Regular Season home games,\nincluding, without limitation, such proceeds received or to\nbe received by a Related Party (in accordance with Section\n1(a)(7)(i) below);

provided, however, that\nthe determination of the amount, if any, to be included in\nBRI shall be made either (A) in accordance with the\nprovisions of Section 1(a)(4) below or (B) based upon direct\nevidence that the parties to the transaction had agreed that\ncertain revenues constituting arena-generated BRI would be\nforegone by the Team or Related Party, in direct exchange\nfor a thing of value as described above in this\nSection 1(a)(2)(xii), and provided, further that, when a\ndetermination is made pursuant to clause (B) of this\nSection 1(a)(2)(xii), the amount(s), if any, to be included in\nBRI shall be allocated (with an appropriate interest\nadjustment to reflect the time value of money where the\nthing of value received by the Team or Related Party is in\nthe form of cash or a cash equivalent, such as a check or wire\ntransfer) over the Salary Cap Years in which the\narena-generated BRI revenues foregone would have been\nreceived by the Team or Related Party (up to a maximum of\nfifteen (15) Salary Cap Years) and not on a lump-sum basis.\nWith respect to transactions involving payments asserted to\nfall within the exclusion in this Section 1(a)(2)(xii), the NBA\nwill provide the Players Association with the executed\nmemoranda of understanding, term sheet, or other such\nexecuted summary of terms, if any, for such underlying\ntransactions;\n(xiii)\nPayments made to Teams or to the NBA pursuant to the\nprovisions of Article VII, Section 12 (Designated Share\nArrangement) below;\n(xiv)\nDistributions, dividends or royalties paid by any\nNBA-related entity to owners, shareholders, members or\npartners;\n(xv)\nAny category or source of revenue or proceeds that was\nexpressly identified in any BRI Report (as defined in\n146\nArticle VII\nSection 10(b) below) or in any document or written\ncommunication (including debriefing memos) authored by\nthe Accountants and provided to the Players Association\nand the NBA (but excluding any underlying work papers) in\nconnection with the Audit Reports for any of the 1995-96\nthrough 2021-22 Salary Cap Years that was not included in\nBRI for such Salary Cap Years, unless such category or\nsource was included on the “open issues” list prepared by\nthe Accountants in connection with any of the Audit\nReports for the 2005-06 through 2021-22 Salary Cap Years,\nin which case such category or source shall be included in or\nexcluded from BRI, as the case may be, in accordance with\nthe other terms of this Article;\n(xvi)\nProceeds received by (A) Properties (and its related entities)\nthat were treated or, consistent with past practice, would\nhave been treated as within the scope of the Agreement\nbetween NBA Properties, Inc., and the National Basketball\nPlayers Association, dated as of September 18, 1995, as\namended January 20, 1999, July 29, 2005 and December 8,\n2011 (the “2011 Group License Agreement”) (including, but\nnot limited to, proceeds received pursuant to the license of\n“fantasy games,” which proceeds would have been included\nin the computation of Player Merchandise Revenues in\naccordance with the 2011 Group License Agreement), or\n(B) a League-related entity relating to the following\ncategories defined in the same manner as was used in the\naudited League Entities’ Combined Financial Statements for\nthe year ended September 30, 2021: (1) licensing, other than\nNet Licensing Revenues to the extent included in BRI\npursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(xviii), above; and/or (2) a\nLeague-related entity’s representation of, and services\nperformed for, third parties. For purposes of the foregoing\nsentence, “third parties” refers to persons or entities that are\nnot owned or controlled by persons or entities that own a\nmajority interest in or otherwise control an NBA Team or,\nif such third party is a Related Party, proceeds received by\nthe League-related entity shall not be included in BRI if\nrepresentation of such Related Party does not relate either\nto such entity’s NBA ownership or NBA Players;\nArticle VII\n(xvii)\n147\nMonies collected from Team-related fundraising for\ncharitable purposes or other charitable activities (including\nTeam-organized “50/50 raffles”), other than monies paid\npursuant to Team sponsorship agreements that are included\nin BRI pursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(v) above;\n(xviii) Proceeds solely related to the NBA 2K League, NBAGL and\nother leagues, teams and basketball organizations (e.g., an\ninternational league) that do not involve the playing of\nbasketball by any then-current NBA players;\n(xix)\nProceeds from the leasing or use of any Team physical assets\n(e.g., a Team plane);\n(xx)\nAny thing of value received from a concessionaire, food\nservice vendor or other third party equipment or service\nprovider that, if received in kind, is installed in an NBA arena\nor, if received in cash, is directed to defraying the costs of\nthe construction or substantial renovation of an NBA arena;\n(xxi)\nProceeds from businesses outside the arena (e.g., restaurants,\ncasinos, hotels, retail businesses, etc.), except for revenues\notherwise included in BRI for Team-identified stores. For\nclarity, the foregoing exclusion will not apply to revenues\nfrom the business operations of the NBA basketball team\nthat are otherwise includable as BRI under other provisions\nof this Agreement, including, without limitation, revenues\nreceived from sales of Team game tickets, media rights,\nsponsorships, signage outside the arena (subject to the\nlimitations set forth in Section 1(a)(1)(vi) above), and arena\nplaza game-day sales of novelties and concessions (subject\nto the limitations set forth in Section 1(a)(1)(v) above);\n(xxii)\nWithout limitation to any other basis for non-inclusion in\nBRI, BRI shall not include the value, if any, of (A) goods or\nservices that are operationally necessary to the performance\nof a contract, including, without limitation, certain ticketing\nplatforms and tools (e.g., Pricemaster, Presence, Open\nDistribution,\nArchtics,\nTicketmaster\nMarketplace,\n148\nArticle VII\nTicketmaster AccountManager), (B) product discounts, or\n(C) waived fees;\n(xxiii) Value, if any, attributable to data received by an NBA-related\nentity (or the right to receive such data), whether or not the\nprovision of such data is pursuant to a contractual\nobligation, other than amounts that are included in BRI\npursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(xx) above; and\n(xxiv) Value, if any, from contractual provisions (including but not\nlimited to those previously identified by the Players\nAssociation in connection with prior BRI audits) that require\nNBA or Team marketing partners to utilize the marketing\nrights purchased from an NBA-related entity in sponsorship\ndeals.\n(3) The parties agree that (i) in determining whether a category or\nsource of revenue or proceeds constitutes BRI: (A) consideration\nshall be given to whether such category or source is more similar in\nkind or nature to the included categories and sources listed in\nSection 1(a)(1)(i) through (xx) above, on the one hand, or to the\nexcluded categories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(2)(i) through\n(xxiv) above, on the other; and (B) no inference may be drawn from\nthe fact that such category or source was not included in the\ncategories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(1)(i) through (xx) above,\nor the fact that such category or source was not included in the\ncategories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(2)(i) through (xxiv)\nabove; and (ii) in any proceeding involving a dispute over (A) the\nincludability or categorization of any revenue or expense item for\nBRI purposes; (B) the amount to be included in or deducted from\nBRI with respect to any revenue or expense item; or (C) the\naccounting methodology used by the Accountants in connection\nwith any audit of BRI, the parties may refer to the past practice of\nthe parties or the Accountants in connection with the Audit Reports\nfor any of the 1999-2000 through 2021-22 Salary Cap Years;\nprovided, however, that no reference may be made to the past\npractice of the parties or the Accountants with respect to any source\nor category of revenue or expense that was included on the “open\nissues” list prepared by the Accountants in connection with any of\nsuch Audit Reports; provided, further, that any such past practice\nArticle VII\n149\nshall be superseded to the extent changed or clarified by the terms\nof this Agreement. In addition, no reference may be made, with\nrespect to expenses related to the NBA’s non-international business,\nto the fact that such category of expenses falls within\nSection 1(a)(14) below, to argue for the inclusion or exclusion of\nexpenses related to the League’s non-international business.\n(4) The parties agree that, with respect to any lease entered into\nafter the date of this Agreement between a Team (or a Related Party)\nand an arena that is not a Related Party, the Accountants may\nattribute to the Team (or a Related Party) for purposes of computing\nBRI for a Salary Cap Year portions of arena revenues received by\nthe arena or its related entities that would be included in BRI if\nreceived by the Team (or a Related Party) to the following extent: in\nthe event of a renewal, extension or renegotiation of a lease between\nthe same parties, or a new lease entered into by a Team (or a Related\nParty) with an arena that is not a Related Party, the Team will be\ndeemed to receive in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the new\nlease or by the renewal, extension or renegotiation of the existing\nlease (as the case may be) the greater of (i) the amount of such\nrevenues that the Team or the Related Party in fact receives under\nthe lease or, (ii) if in the opinion of the Accountants, the Team\n(and/or the Related Party) is receiving substantially less than fair\nmarket value as determined by the Accountants (taking into account\nfactors such as the rent paid by the Team or the Related Party, the\nnumber and identity of other major tenants in the arena, market\nconditions, the extent to which arena revenues are used to fund\nconstruction or renovations of the arena, and comparable lease\narrangements in the NBA), an amount determined by the\nAccountants to constitute the fair market value of the revenues that\na tenant, in the same circumstances as the Team or Related Party,\nwould receive for such Salary Cap Year. In either of the preceding\ncases, the Accountants will also determine the amount to be\nincluded in BRI for Salary Cap Years beyond the first Salary Cap\nYear.\n(5) (i) In no event shall the same revenues be included in BRI,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result\nof changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose\nof this provision being to preclude the double-counting of\n150\nArticle VII\nrevenues, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap\nYears.\n(ii)\nIn no event shall the same expenses be deducted from BRI,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result\nof changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose\nof this provision being to preclude the double-counting of\nexpenses, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap\nYears.\n(6) Subject to Section 11 below (Players Association Audit Rights):\n(i)\nWith respect to expenses incurred in connection with all\nproceeds coming within Section 1(a)(1)(v) above, all\nreported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be\nreasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be\nthe subject of the accounting procedures set forth in Section\n10 below.\n(ii)\nWith respect to expenses incurred in connection with all\nproceeds coming within Section 1(a)(1)(ix) above that are\nconsistent with the types and categories of expenses incurred\nby Properties as reflected in the audited financial reports of\nProperties for the year ended July 31, 1994, (1) all such\nreported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be\nreasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be\nthe subject of the accounting procedures set forth in Section\n10 below, but (2) such expenses shall be disallowed to the\nextent they exceed the ratio of expenses to revenues for the\ncategory of revenues set forth in Exhibit D hereto.\n(iii)\nWith respect to the NBA Store (the “Store”) and any other\nnew venture or business (whether or not involving the\ncreation of a new entity) undertaken by the NBA, Properties,\nMedia Ventures, or any other League-related entity requiring\nsignificant capital investment or start-up costs (“New\nVenture”), the League-related entities shall be able to deduct\nfrom BRI reasonable and customary expenses related\nthereto, including, but not limited to, cost of goods sold,\nsales tax, all reasonable operating expenses of the Store or\nArticle VII\n151\nNew Venture (including, but not limited to, salaries and\nbenefits directly related to the operations of the Store or\nNew Venture, promotional and advertising costs, rent, direct\noverhead, general and administrative expenses of the Store\nor New Venture), reasonable financing costs and\namortization of capital improvements and start-up costs;\nprovided, however, that in no event shall the expenses\nattributable to the Store or New Venture cause the amount\nincluded in BRI for the Store or New Venture to be less than\nzero (0) for any Salary Cap Year.\n(iv)\nWith respect to miscellaneous BRI or new categories of BRI\n(other than revenues attributable to the Store or a New\nVenture), the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, other\nLeague-related entities, Teams and Related Parties shall be\nable to deduct all reasonable and customary expenses\n(including reasonable and customary Taxes), including, for\nexample, in connection with All-Star Weekend, subject to\nthe terms of this Section 1(a)(6).\n(v)\nIn each Salary Cap Year, except for (A) Team Content\nRevenues and Team Content Expenses (as defined below)\nand (B) Playoff-Related Revenues and Expenses (as defined\nbelow), all Team and Related Party revenues included in, and\nall Team and Related Party expenses deducted from, BRI are\nsubject to an aggregate uniform percentage-of-revenues\nexpense cap of eleven and one-tenth percent (11.1%) (see\nalso Exhibit D hereto), with any such expenses disallowed\nto the extent they exceed that cap. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, for the 2021-22 Salary Cap Year, the total Team and\nRelated Party revenues and expenses that would have been\nsubject to the new eleven and one-tenth percent (11.1%)\nexpense cap were the amounts identified in the parties’ letter\nagreement, dated June 28, 2023. For the purposes of this\nArticle VII, Section 1, (1) “Team Content Revenues” and\n“Team Content Expenses” mean, respectively, revenues and\nrelated expenses from local TV, cable, and Team direct-toconsumer media and (2) “Playoff-Related Revenues and\nExpenses” means the revenues and expenses reported in the\n“playoff gate receipts, net” amount shown in the Audit\n152\nArticle VII\nReport for the 2015-16 Salary Cap Year. Team Content\nRevenues, Team Content Expenses, and Playoff-Related\nRevenues and Expenses are not subject to the above\nuniform expense cap. Team Content Expenses will be\ndeductible and uncapped, and will include, without\nlimitation those expenses identified in the parties’ letter\nagreement, dated June 28, 2023. Playoff-related expenses\nwill continue to be deductible in accordance with the terms\nof the 2011 CBA as reflected in the Audit Report for the\n2015-16 Salary Cap Year. For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes\nwill be deducted from revenues included in BRI under\nSections 1(a)(1)(i), (iii), (vi), (vii), (viii), (x), (xi), (xiii), (xiv),\n(xviii), and (xix) (to the extent set forth in those subsections)\nbefore the application of the eleven and one-tenth percent\n(11.1%) ratio in calculating the uniform expense cap, and\nbefore the deduction of expenses.\n(vi)\nTo the extent that, for a Salary Cap Year, total Team Content\nExpenses and League Content Expenses (inclusive of\nNBAE and ITV expenses after application of caps) exceeds\nthe product of Team Content Revenues and League Content\nRevenues (inclusive of NBAE and ITV revenues) multiplied\nby the Rollover Ratio (as defined below), that excess would\nbe amortized over such Salary Cap Year and the next two\nSalary Cap Years. The “Rollover Ratio” shall be eighteen\nand one-half percent (18.5%), except that, beginning in the\n2026-27 Salary Cap Year, the Rollover Ratio shall be the\nhigher of (A) eighteen and one-half percent (18.5%) or\n(B) the highest actual ratio of Team Content Expenses and\nLeague Content Expenses to Team Content Revenues and\nLeague Content Revenues in any of the preceding Salary Cap\nYears under the CBA. Any amortized amount would be\nexcluded from each Salary Cap Year’s rollover threshold\ncalculation. An imputed interest rate equal to the 1-month\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.225% (calculated\nas of the July 1 of the Salary Cap Year during which such\ninterest accrues) will be applied on amortized amounts and\nrecouped in each Salary Cap Year in which amounts are\namortized. For the purposes of this Article VII, Section 1,\n“League Content Revenues” and “League Content\nArticle VII\n153\nExpenses” mean, respectively, revenues and expenses\nrelated to all NBA and League-related content categories of\nBRI, including Digital, International League Pass (DBS),\nNBAE, ITV, Media Ventures, Radio, and National TV. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, League Content Expenses will\nremain deductible and, with the exception of NBAE and\nITV, uncapped.\nFor example, if, in the 2025-26 Salary Cap Year, the sum of\nTeam Content Revenues and League Content Revenues\nwere $5 billion, and the sum of Team Content Expenses and\nLeague Content Expenses (after application of caps on\nNBAE and ITV expenses) were $1 billion, and the imputed\ninterest rate calculated pursuant to this Section 1(a)(6)(vi)\nwere four percent (4%), then the amortized amount would\nbe $75 million (i.e., $1 billion – $925 million (i.e., 18.5% of\n$5 billion)). $25 million of the amortized amount would be\ndeducted from BRI in the 2025-26 Salary Cap Year. In the\n2026-27 Salary Cap Year, the amortized amount to be\ndeducted from BRI in respect of the 2025-26 Salary Cap\nYear would be $26 million (i.e., $25 million, grown at four\npercent (4%) interest per Salary Cap Year for one Salary Cap\nYear). In the 2027-28 Salary Cap Year, the amortized\namount to be deducted from BRI in respect of the 2025-26\nSalary Cap Year would be $27.04 million (i.e., $25 million,\ngrown at four percent (4%) interest per Salary Cap Year for\ntwo Salary Cap Years).\n(7) It is acknowledged by the parties hereto that for purposes of\ndetermining BRI:\n(i)\nSome NBA Teams have engaged or may engage in\ntransactions with third parties that control, or own at least\nfifty percent (50%) of, the NBA Team or that are controlled\nor owned at least fifty percent (50%) by the persons or\nentities controlling or owning at least fifty percent (50%) of\nthe NBA Team (such third parties are referred to in this\nAgreement as a “Related Party”), and Related Parties\nthemselves engage in transactions with third parties that may\nresult in a Related Party’s receipt of revenues that constitute\n154\nArticle VII\nBRI. (Any entity that was an “entity related to an NBA\nteam” as defined by Article VII, Section 1(a)(4)(i) of the\nSeptember 18, 1995 Collective Bargaining Agreement\nbetween the NBA and the Players Association (the “1995\nCBA”) shall be deemed a Related Party under this\nAgreement for so long as such entity continues to be an\nentity related to an NBA Team within the meaning of the\n1995 CBA.) As provided in Section 1(a)(1) above, the\nrelevant proceeds received by any Related Party that come\nwithin such subsection and that relate to such Related Party’s\nTeam shall be included in BRI. However, except in\nconnection with telecast agreements (which are subject to\nSection 1(a)(7)(ii) below), with respect to any such revenues\nor proceeds retained or received by a Related Party (other\nthan arena revenues that relate to such Related Party’s Team\nincluding, but not limited to, in-arena sales of novelties and\nconcessions, NBA game parking, arena club revenues, suite\nand seat revenues and fixed and temporary in-arena signage,\nwhich shall be included in BRI as if received by the Team),\nor by a Team pursuant to a transaction with a Related Party,\nsuch revenues or proceeds shall be included in BRI only to\nthe extent that the NBA and the Players Association agree\nor, if they fail to agree, the Accountants shall reasonably\ndetermine the amount, if any, of such revenues or proceeds\nto attribute to the Team (taking into account factors such as\nthe nature of the transaction, arrangement and/or\nrelationship between the Team and the Related Party or\nbetween the Related Party and a third party, any amounts\nincluded in BRI with respect to other Teams (or Related\nParties) that have entered into comparable transactions,\narrangements and/or relationships with third parties, market\nconditions, the nature of any services or activities performed\nby the Related Party for, or in connection with, the\ngeneration of revenues or proceeds and the amount of\nrevenues or proceeds that the Related Party would be\nexpected to retain or receive with respect to comparable\ntransactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third\nparties), and the amount so attributed shall be the only\namount included in BRI. To the extent that the amount of\nsuch proceeds to be included in BRI cannot reasonably be\nArticle VII\n155\ndetermined with respect to any particular transaction, the\nAccountants shall determine a reasonable amount with\nrespect to such transaction, which shall be included in BRI.\n(In the event the Accountants refuse to make any such\ndetermination, such determination shall be made by a jointly\nselected expert with respect to any such transaction.)\nWithout limiting the foregoing, in no event shall BRI include\nconsideration paid to a Related Party in connection with\nrights acquired by such Related Party from a Team for fair\nmarket value, even if such consideration relates to NBA\ngames or NBA-related activities (including, by way of\nexample and not limitation, advertising revenue or\nsubscriber fees earned by a Related Party television network\nthat relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of NBA\ngames licensed to the television network by a Team).\n(ii)\nIn the event that, following the execution of this Agreement,\na Team (other than the New York Knicks (“Knicks”)) enters\ninto a local or regional telecast agreement with a Related\nParty, a copy of such agreement shall be provided to the\nPlayers Association within ten (10) days of approval of such\nagreement by the NBA. The Players Association and the\nNBA shall each have the right, not later than ten (10) days\nfollowing the date on which the Players Association receives\na copy of such agreement, to submit such agreement to a\njointly-selected television valuation expert or (in the absence\nof such agreement) determined in accordance with the\nprocedure set forth in this subsection (“TV Expert”) for the\nlimited purpose set forth in this Section 1(a)(7)(ii). In the\nevent that a party has so elected to submit such agreement\nto a TV Expert and the parties have not jointly selected a TV\nExpert within twenty (20) days following the date on which\nthe Players Association receives a copy of such agreement,\neach party shall appoint its own television valuation designee\nand the two designees so appointed shall within ten (10) days\nof their appointment, jointly select a third party to serve as\nthe TV Expert. Such TV Expert shall review such\nagreement to determine if the aggregate amount to be paid\nto the Team by the Related Party for the rights to telecast\nthe Team’s games pursuant to such agreement is more than\n156\nArticle VII\nfifteen percent (15%) above or more than fifteen percent\n(15%) below the fair market value of such rights over the\nterm of such agreement. In making such determination, the\nTV Expert may take into account factors such as the nature\nof the transaction, arrangement and/or relationship between\nthe Team and the Related Party, any amounts included in\nBRI with respect to other Teams (or Related Parties) that\nhave entered into comparable transactions, arrangements\nand/or relationships with other programming licensors,\nmarket conditions, the nature of any services or activities\nperformed by the Related Party for, or in connection with,\nthe generation of revenues or proceeds and the amount of\nrevenues or proceeds that the Related Party would be\nexpected to retain or receive with respect to comparable\ntransactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third\nparties; provided that in no event shall BRI include\nconsideration paid to a Related Party in connection with\nrights acquired by such Related Party from a Team for fair\nmarket value, even if such consideration relates to NBA\ngames or NBA-related activities (including, by way of\nexample and not limitation, advertising revenue or\nsubscriber fees earned by a Related Party television network\nthat relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of NBA\ngames licensed to the television network by a Team). In the\nevent that the TV Expert determines that such aggregate\namount is more than fifteen percent (15%) above or below\nfair market value, the TV Expert shall be instructed to\nsubmit to the parties the amount for each Season of such\nagreement that he determines reflects the fair market value\nof such rights and such amounts, and no other amounts,\nshall be included in BRI with respect to such agreement for\neach Salary Cap Year covered by such agreement. Any\ndetermination made by the TV Expert pursuant to either of\nthe preceding two sentences shall be submitted to the parties\nno later than twenty (20) days from the date on which such\nagreement was submitted to the TV Expert for his review.\nAny fees or costs associated with the retention or\ndetermination of the TV Expert shall be borne equally by\nthe Players Association and NBA. The Players Association\nand the TV Expert shall maintain the confidentiality of any\nArticle VII\n157\nsuch agreement (and any determination made by the TV\nexpert in accordance with this Section 1(a)(7)(ii)) pursuant\nto the terms of Section 11(c) below relating to the\nconfidentiality of BRI Audits.\n(iii)\nWith respect to the transactions listed below in this\nSection 1(a)(7)(iii), the parties agree that, because the\nproceeds attributable to these transactions cannot be\naccurately ascertained, the following procedures shall be\nused for each NBA Season in which MSG Network is a\nRelated Party of the Knicks (in the case of\nSection 1(a)(7)(iii)(A) below) and the Madison Square\nGarden arena is a Related Party of the Knicks (in the case of\nSection 1(a)(7)(iii)(B) below):\n(A)\nNew York Knicks transaction with MSG Network\nregarding the sale of local media rights: BRI for the\nKnicks for each NBA Season covered by this\nAgreement shall include an amount equal to the net\nproceeds included in BRI attributable to the Los\nAngeles Lakers’ sale, license or other conveyance of\nall local media rights (including, but not limited to,\nbroadcast and cable television and radio) for such\nNBA season.\n(B)\nNew York Knicks transactions with Related Parties\ninvolving signage: BRI for the Knicks for the\n2021-22 NBA Season shall include $16,560,026 for\nsignage. In each subsequent Season covered by this\nAgreement, this amount shall be increased (or\ndecreased, as the case may be) by the League-wide\npercentage increase (or decrease) in signage as\ndetermined in accordance with Sections 1(a)(1)(v)\nand (a)(1)(vi) above.\nAt such time as the MSG Network and/or the\nMadison Square Garden Arena are no longer Related\nParties, BRI for the New York Knicks in the\ncategories described in Section 1(a)(7)(iii)(A) and/or\n(B) above, as the case may be, shall not be\n158\nArticle VII\ndetermined in accordance with the foregoing and\nwill instead be determined by the applicable\nprovisions of Sections 1(a)(1) and (a)(7)(ii) above.\n(8) In the event that, pursuant to the NBA’s national broadcast,\nnational telecast and network cable television agreements, NBA\nTeams receive revenue sharing proceeds that are attributable to\nNBA game telecasts in more than one Salary Cap Year, such\nproceeds shall be allocated over the same number of Salary Cap\nYears (beginning with first Salary Cap Year after the Salary Cap Year\nin which such proceeds are actually received) as the number of Salary\nCap Years in which such games were televised. Any other\ncontingent payments received by the NBA pursuant to such\nagreements shall be included in BRI to the extent and in a manner\nagreed upon by the parties, or, if the parties cannot agree, in a\nreasonable manner determined by the Accountants.\n(9) The NBA and each NBA Team shall in good faith act and use\ntheir commercially reasonable efforts to increase BRI for each Salary\nCap Year during the term of this Agreement. In the exercise of such\ncommercially reasonable efforts, the NBA and each NBA Team\nshall be entitled to act in a manner consistent with their reasonable\nbusiness judgment and shall not (i) take any action intended to\nbenefit, at the expense of BRI, other commercial activities (such as\nthe WNBA and the NBAGL) unrelated to the performance of\nPlayers in NBA basketball games or in NBA-related activities, or\n(ii) shift or forgo revenues attributable to Salary Cap Years during\nthe term of this Agreement in exchange for revenues or benefits\nduring Salary Cap Years following the expiration of this Agreement\n(unless there is a reasonable business justification unrelated to\ncollective bargaining for such shift or forgoing). There shall be no\nobligation on the part of the NBA or any NBA Team to accelerate\ninto Salary Cap Years within the term of this Agreement revenues\nattributable to Salary Cap Years following the expiration of this\nAgreement. In evaluating compliance with this subsection, the\nparties and the System Arbitrator shall consider and give substantial\nweight to the reasonable business judgment of the NBA or the NBA\nTeam but no deference will be applied where the NBA is alleged to\nhave shifted or forgone revenues of $350 million or more for the\npurpose of securing leverage in collective bargaining, in which case\nArticle VII\n159\nany finding of non-compliance shall require proof by a clear\npreponderance of the evidence. The following is a list of decisions\nin respect of which the business judgment of the NBA or an NBA\nTeam shall conclusively be deemed reasonable: membership\nlocation; arena capacity or configuration; number and location of\ngames played; whether to outsource or operate a line of business;\nand whether to accept or decline a sponsorship, advertising or\nnaming rights opportunity. The foregoing list shall not limit in any\nmanner the circumstances in which the business judgment of the\nNBA or an NBA Team may be deemed reasonable.\n(10) The parties agree that upon a finding by the System Arbitrator\n(which, if appealed, is affirmed by the Appeals Panel) that the NBA\nor an NBA Team (or a Related Party) has willfully failed to provide\nto the Accountants information concerning revenues or expenses\nmaterial to the Accountants’ preparation of an Audit Report, and\nthat such failure to provide information resulted in an\nunderstatement of BRI of more than $5,511,614 with respect to the\n2023-24 Salary Cap Year (increasing by four and one-half percent\n(4.5%) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year of this Agreement,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year), then the amount by\nwhich BRI was understated shall be included in BRI in the Salary\nCap Year in which such finding is made, with interest accruing from\nthe date of the Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year in which such\namount would have been included but for such understatement,\nwith interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as\npublished in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the issuance of\nsuch Audit Report). In addition, if any Team, or if the NBA, violates\nthe foregoing, it shall be fined $3 million for its first violation during\nthe term of this Agreement and an additional $1.5 million for each\nadditional violation. (For example, if a Team violates the foregoing\nfor the first time, it shall be fined $3 million; if such Team violates\nthe foregoing a second time, it shall be fined $4.5 million; and if such\nTeam violates the foregoing a third time, it shall be fined $6 million.)\nFifty percent (50%) of any such fine amounts shall be remitted by\nthe NBA to an NBPA-Selected Charitable Organization (as defined\nin Article VI, Section 6 above) and fifty percent (50%) shall be\nremitted by the NBA to a Section 501(c)(3) Organization selected\nby the NBA.\n160\nArticle VII\n(11) Neither the NBA or a League-related entity nor a Team or a\nRelated Party will enter into any lease or other agreement providing\nfor the receipt of revenues includable in BRI that contains\nprovisions that purport to limit access of the Accountants to the\nbooks and records of the NBA, such League-related entity, such\nTeam, or such Related Party in a manner inconsistent with the terms\nof this Agreement or that would preclude the calculation of revenues\n(if any) to be included in BRI pursuant to the provisions of\nSection 1(a)(1)(xii) above.\n(12) Premium payments made by a Team for any insurance that, if\npaid, would be includable in BRI pursuant to Section 1(a)(2)(ix)\nabove, shall be deducted from such Team’s BRI for the Salary Cap\nYear in which any such insurance recovery is received.\n(13) Equity Transactions.\n(i)\nThe value of equity securities received by NBA-related\nentities (as defined in Section 1(a)(2) above) in entities that\nwere not NBA-related entities prior to such receipt, to the\nextent otherwise constituting BRI under this Agreement,\nshall be included in BRI as follows:\n(A) if the equity securities (including contingent securities,\nas defined below) are Publicly Tradable when received,\nthe Publicly Traded Value of those securities will be\nincluded in BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich they are received;\n(B)\nif the equity securities consist of options, warrants,\nconvertible securities or similar securities (“contingent\nsecurities”), and (x) those contingent securities are\nsold, the Net Proceeds will be included in BRI\ncommencing in the Salary Cap Year in which the sale\noccurs, or (y) those contingent securities are exercised\nor converted into other securities that are or become\nPublicly Tradable, the Publicly Traded Value of the\nresulting securities (net of any exercise or conversion\nprice and taxes, as determined below) will be included\nin BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which\nArticle VII\n161\nthe exercise or conversion occurs (if the resulting\nsecurities were Publicly Tradable at that time) or in the\nSalary Cap Year in which the resulting securities later\nbecome Publicly Tradable, whichever is first;\n(C)\nif the equity securities (including contingent securities\nand any securities resulting from the exercise or\nconversion of contingent securities) are not Publicly\nTradable at the time of receipt (or, in the case of\ncontingent securities, at the time of exercise or\nconversion), no BRI value shall be attributable to such\nsecurities until (x) they become Publicly Tradable or\nare sold or otherwise transferred for consideration\nother than securities that are not Publicly Tradable,\nwhichever is first, at which time the Publicly Traded\nValue or Net Proceeds, as applicable, will be included\nin BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which\nsuch event occurs or (y) they are specifically pledged\nand valued as part of a transaction that provides\nliquidity without selling the equity position, even if\nother assets are also pledged as a part of such\ntransaction, in which case BRI will include an amount\nequal to the specific value assigned to the equity\nsecurities (“Specifically Assigned Value”) commencing\nin the Salary Cap Year in which they are specifically\npledged and valued; or\n(D) notwithstanding the foregoing, if any contingent\nsecurities are exercisable or convertible into securities\nthat are or become Publicly Tradable, but those\ncontingent securities are not exercised or converted\nwithin one (1) year of any such right, the Players\nAssociation shall have the right, by written notice to\nthe NBA, to have the Publicly Traded Value of such\nsecurities included in BRI as if those contingent\nsecurities had been exercised or converted on the date\nof such notice (net of any exercise or conversion price\nand taxes, as determined below).\n162\nArticle VII\n(ii)\nFor purposes of this Section 1(a)(13), (A) “Publicly\nTradable” means (x) the applicable equity securities have\nbeen registered for sale under applicable state, federal and\nforeign laws, are listed and tradable on a generally recognized\nstock exchange or in the over-the-counter market, or (y) the\napplicable equity securities can be readily purchased and sold\non a nationally recognized secondary market (e.g., without\nlimitation on any example, shares in “Facebook” as of the\ndate of the 2011 CBA), and in each case under (x) and (y),\nany contractual or other prohibition or limitation on sale\nwould not preclude a sale; (B) “Publicly Traded Value”\nmeans the weighted average daily trading price of the\napplicable equity securities for the thirty (30) trading days\n(x) preceding the date of receipt if the securities are Publicly\nTradable prior to that date or (y) following the date they\nbecome Publicly Tradable; provided that if such equity\nsecurities are sold during the Salary Cap Year in which their\nPublicly Traded Value is first included in BRI, the “Publicly\nTraded Value” of such equity securities shall be the Net\nProceeds from such sale; (C) “Net Proceeds” means the\nproceeds received by the selling entity from the applicable\nsale, net of commissions and reasonable expenses relating to\nsuch sale, any exercise or conversion price with respect to\nsecurities resulting from the exercise or conversion of\ncontingent securities, and any applicable taxes of the selling\nentity (or if the selling entity is a pass-through entity for\nincome tax purposes, such entity’s owners), which shall be\ndetermined using a tax rate equivalent to the highest\nmarginal combined federal, state and local tax rate that\nwould be applicable in the locale where the principal place\nof business of the selling entity is located, which in the case\nof a Team or a Related Party of a Team shall be deemed to\nbe the locale of the arena in which the Team plays more than\none-half of its Regular Season home games; and (D) a sale\nof equity securities shall not be subject to inclusion in BRI if\nthe sale is part of a larger transaction in which (x) BRI has\nbeen fully accounted for or (y) all or substantially all of the\nassets of an NBA-related entity or business unit thereof are\nsold and such equity securities do not represent a majority\nof the value in such transaction. In all cases, the Publicly\nArticle VII\n163\nTraded Value of, Net Proceeds from, or Specifically\nAssigned Value of the applicable equity securities will be\nincluded in BRI over a five (5) year amortization period\n(inclusive of the Salary Cap Year in which such Publicly\nTraded or Specifically Assigned Value is first included in\nBRI), even if such equity securities are sold during such\nfive (5) year period.\n(iii)\nFor the avoidance of doubt, (A) in no event shall the value\nof, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in\nNBA-related entities be included in BRI, and (B) the value\nof, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in\nnon-NBA-related entities shall be included in BRI\nexclusively pursuant to this Section 1(a)(13), and only once\nunder the applicable provision of Section 1(a)(13)(i) above.\n(14) International Development and Operations Expenses. The NBA and\nLeague-related entities may deduct from BRI expenses related to the\ndevelopment and operation of the League’s international business\n(“Newly-Deductible International Expenses”), subject to a limit of\nten percent (10%) of the League’s gross BRI international revenues\n(the allowed amount of such expense following application of the\nten percent (10%) cap being the “Allowed Newly-Deductible\nInternational Expenses”).\nNewly-Deductible International\nExpenses for any Salary Cap Year shall include all such international\nexpenses incurred at the League level that are not otherwise\ndeductible under this Agreement (excluding expenses in\ncurrently-deductible categories that are in excess of applicable\npercentage-of-revenue expense caps and the write-down of equity\ninvestments). For the purposes of this Agreement, the League’s\ngross BRI international revenue and Newly-Deductible\nInternational Expenses for the 2021-22 Salary Cap Year were the\namounts set forth in the parties’ letter agreement dated\nJune 28, 2023.\n(15) Miscellaneous BRI Accounting Rules.\n(i)\nTeam charter travel expenses for Regular Season games,\nassociated with broadcast and other personnel for whom\nsuch travel expenses are otherwise deductible (for example,\n164\nArticle VII\nwithout limitation on any other example, Team personnel\ntraveling in connection with the sale of Team sponsorships),\nshall be deductible at fifty percent (50%).\n(ii)\nBRI for premium seating, in respect of: (A) bunker, super,\nand party suites, (B) theatre boxes, loge boxes, and other\nsuch non-traditional premium seating inventory, and\n(C) traditional club seats, shall be calculated by using the\nparties’ previously-agreed upon methods, as reflected in the\nAudit Report for the 2015-16 Salary Cap Year.\n(iii)\nTo the extent salary paid to a person who also owns an\ninterest in the Team would otherwise be deductible from\nBRI, such salary shall only be deductible for BRI purposes\nonly if all of the following criteria are met and if the expense\notherwise qualifies for such deduction (for example, without\nlimitation, the salary is related to the BRI against which it is\ndeducted): (A) the owner owns less than seven and one-half\npercent (7.5%) of the Team; (B) the job being performed by\nthe owner would otherwise be performed by a non-owner\nstaff member; (C) the job being performed by the owner is\nhis/her full time job and he/she has no other roles with\noutside companies (with the exception of limited duty Board\nroles); (D) the salary being earned is reasonable and\ncustomary, relative to what a non-owner staff member\nwould earn, for the services being provided; and (E) there\nare no other individuals performing substantially the same\nrole employed by the Team where the role is such that\nordinarily there is only one person performing it (for\nexample, without limitation, Team president).\n(iv)\nWith respect to expenses associated with League-related\nentity advertising and public relations campaigns: (A) the\nexpenses will be allocated to BRI and non-BRI revenue\ncategories according to the methodology agreed to by the\nparties in connection with the final Audit Report for the\n2015-16 Salary Cap Year, except that such expenses shall\nalso be allocated to the NBA’s Regular Season gate\nassessment during the Salary Cap Year in addition to the\nother categories previously included in the allocation; and\nArticle VII\n165\n(B) the expenses shall be deducted from BRI, subject to\nSection 1(a)(6)(ii) above.\n(v)\nRevenues and expenses related to the new In-Season\nTournament (“IST”) shall be included in BRI as follows:\n(A) revenues and expenses from home-market Group Stage\ngames and IST Quarterfinals games not played in a neutral\nmarket will be treated as if earned or incurred during a\nRegular Season game; (B) notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in this Agreement, including, without limitation,\nArticle XX, Section 4(c), for purposes of Article VII,\nSection 1(a), revenues and expenses from neutral-market\ngames will be treated as league “Special Events,” subject to\nthe 100% expense cap for Special Events, except that, during\nthe 2023-24 and 2024-25 Salary Cap Years only, 50% of the\nexpenses related to any neutral-market IST game (other than\nthe IST Finals Game, and excluding any payments from the\nNBA to Teams described in the succeeding subpart) will be\ntreated as Team expenses subject to Section (1)(a)(6)(v)\nabove; and (C) payments from the NBA to Teams for\nparticipation in neutral-market IST games will be included in\nmiscellaneous BRI at the Team level, with the NBA\nrecording an expense relating to such payment at the League\nlevel in Special Events.\n(vi)\nBarter otherwise includable in BRI will not be excluded\nsolely on the basis that the bartered-for goods or services\nwere not used. For the avoidance of doubt, expenses\nassociated with the receipt and use of bartered goods or\nservices will be deductible from BRI subject to rules\napplicable to other expenses (e.g., that a barter expense is\ndeductible only where it relates to a category that allows for\ndeduction of expenses).\n(b) Accounting Methods/Lump Sum Payments.\n(1) Subject to Sections 1(b)(2) and (b)(3) below, and any provision\nhereof that expressly provides for an alternative accounting\ntreatment, BRI for each Salary Cap Year shall be calculated\nexclusively pursuant to the accrual method of financial accounting\n166\nArticle VII\n(and not, for any purpose, the cash method of financial accounting)\nand in accordance with United States Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles. By way of example, and not limitation, in\nthe event a team receives a signing bonus in consideration for its\nagreement to enter into a five (5) year contract for the local telecast\nof its games, such signing bonus shall be amortized in equal annual\namounts over the five (5) Salary Cap Years covered by such\ntelevision contract.\n(2) Except as otherwise provided in the case of luxury suites and\npremium seat licenses, in no event shall the amortization period for\nany lump sum payment exceed seven (7) years.\n(3) Any payments that constitute BRI and that are subject to being\nrepaid to the payor under certain circumstances (the\n“Contingencies”) shall constitute BRI in the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich such payments would have been earned but for the\nContingencies unless, at the time of such payments, the\nContingencies under which the payments would be repaid are likely\nto occur, in which case the payments will not be included in BRI\nunless and until such time as the Contingencies under which such\nrepayments would be made do not occur or are not likely to occur.\nIn the event that a payment that has been included in BRI is\nsubsequently repaid, BRI shall be reduced by the amount of such\nrepayment in the Salary Cap Year in which such repayment is made.\nIn any proceeding commenced before the System Arbitrator relating\nto the terms of this Section 1(b)(3), the NBA will bear the burden of\ndemonstrating that the applicable Contingencies are likely to occur.\n(4) With respect to lump sum payments (e.g., signing bonuses) that\nconstitute BRI and are received by a Team or Related Party under\nagreements entered into by a Team or Related Party, for the period,\nif any, between (x) the date when the lump sum payment is received\nand (y) the beginning of the Salary Cap Year when the amortization\nperiod for the lump sum payment begins pursuant to Section 1(b)(1)\nabove, BRI shall include in each applicable Salary Cap Year during\nthis period imputed interest on the amount of such lump sum\npayment at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as\npublished in The Wall Street Journal on the date the payment was\nreceived; provided, however, that such imputed interest shall only\nArticle VII\n167\nbe calculated and included in BRI if each of the following is satisfied:\n(i) the lump sum payment received by the Team or Related Party is\nin the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more; (ii) the\nlump sum payment is received by the Team or Related Party at least\ntwelve (12) months before the start of the Salary Cap Year in which\nit will first be included in BRI under Section 1(b)(1) above; and (iii)\nthe lump sum payment is not related to a ticket, luxury suite or seat\nlicensing transaction including, without limitation, revenues\nincluded in BRI under Sections 1(a)(1)(i), 1(a)(1)(vii), and 1(a)(1)(x)\nabove.\n(5) Loan proceeds from contractual counterparties that would be\nincluded in BRI if received as payment (rather than a loan) will be\nincluded in BRI if there is no realistic expectation of repayment,\nsubject to application of the lump sum amortization rules in this\nSection 1(b) and allocations for multi-element deals. If amounts in\nrespect of such a loan are included in BRI, but the loan is\nsubsequently repaid, BRI shall be reduced by the amount of such\nrepayment in the Salary Cap Year in which such repayment is made.\n(c) “Projected BRI” for a Salary Cap Year means the amount\ndetermined as follows: Prior to the start of each Salary Cap Year, the NBA\nand the Players Association shall meet for the purpose of agreeing upon\nProjected BRI for that Salary Cap Year. In the absence of an agreement of\nthe parties otherwise on or prior to the last day of the Moratorium Period\nof the applicable Salary Cap Year, Projected BRI for such Salary Cap Year\nshall be the sum of amounts determined in accordance with the following:\n(1) With respect to BRI sources other than national broadcast,\nnational telecast or network cable television contracts, Projected\nBRI shall include BRI for the preceding Salary Cap Year, increased\nby four and one-half percent (4.5%). For purposes of this\nSection 1(c)(1), a contract between or among any League-related\nentities and/or Teams shall not be considered national broadcast,\nnational telecast or network cable television contracts.\n(2) With respect to national broadcast, national telecast or network\ncable television contracts including the NBA/ABC agreement dated\nOctober 3, 2014 (“NBA/ABC Agreement”) (a copy of which has\nbeen provided to the Players Association) and the NBA/TBS\n168\nArticle VII\nagreement, dated October 3, 2014 (“NBA/TBS Agreement”) (a\ncopy of which has been provided to the Players Association), and\nnational broadcast, national telecast or network cable television\ncontracts covering Seasons that succeed the Seasons covered by the\nNBA/ABC and NBA/TBS Agreements (“Successor Agreements”)\n(copies of which shall be provided to the Players Association within\nten (10) days of execution), Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year shall\ninclude (i) the rights fees or other non-contingent payments stated\nin such contracts with respect to the Season covered by such Salary\nCap Year (as such rights fees or non-contingent payments may be\nadjusted by agreement of the parties to such contracts); (ii) the\namounts of revenue sharing proceeds, if any, that are includable in\nBRI for such Salary Cap Year pursuant to Section 1(a)(8) above;\n(iii) the amounts with respect to contingent payments (other than\nrevenue sharing proceeds), if any, attributable to Salary Cap Years\ncovered by this Agreement in Successor Agreements as such\namounts are agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties do not reach\nagreement, by the Accountants; and (iv) the amount included in BRI\nfor the preceding Salary Cap Year with respect to the value of\nadvertising or promotional time provided to the NBA as part of the\nNBA/ABC and NBA/TBS Agreements (or any Successor\nAgreements) that is used for any purpose other than those listed in\nSections 1(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(D).\n(3) In no event shall the same amounts be included in Projected\nBRI or Interim Projected BRI, directly or indirectly, more than once\n(including in the event that the terms of any Successor Agreements\nwould cause the same amounts to be indirectly included in Projected\nBRI or Interim Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year pursuant to\nboth subsections (1) and (2) above), the purpose of this provision\nbeing to preclude the double-counting of amounts in the calculation\nof Projected BRI or Interim Projected BRI, whether in the same or\nin multiple Salary Cap Years.\n(d) “Local Expansion Team BRI” means the BRI of the Expansion\nTeams during their first two (2) Seasons, but not including the Expansion\nTeams’ share of League-wide revenues that are otherwise included in BRI\n(including, but not limited to, their share of national television, cable, radio\nand other broadcast revenues).\nArticle VII\n169\n(e) “Projected Local Expansion Team BRI” means Local Expansion\nTeam BRI for the immediately preceding Season, increased by four and\none-half percent (4.5%).\n(f) “Interim Projected BRI” means a projection of BRI for a Salary Cap\nYear using Estimated BRI in place of BRI for the previous Salary Cap Year.\n(g) “Barter” means to trade by exchanging one commodity, service or\nother non-cash item for another.\n(h) “Estimated Total Benefits” means the estimate of Total Benefits for\na Salary Cap Year as set forth in the Interim Audit Report (as defined in\nSection 10(a) below) for such Salary Cap Year.\n(i) “Estimated Total Salaries” means the estimate of Total Salaries for\na Salary Cap Year as set forth in the Interim Audit Report for such Salary\nCap Year.\n(j) “Estimated Total Salaries and Benefits” means the sum of Estimated\nTotal Benefits and Estimated Total Salaries for a Salary Cap Year as set forth\nin the Interim Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.\n(k) “Estimated BRI” means the estimate of BRI for a Salary Cap Year\nas set forth in the Interim Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year."

The Salary Cap for each Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the Term of this Agreement will equal forty-four and\nseventy-four one hundredths percent (44.74%) of Projected BRI for\nsuch Salary Cap Year, less Projected Benefits for such Salary Cap\nYear, divided by the number of Teams scheduled to play in the NBA\nduring such Salary Cap Year, other than Expansion Teams during\ntheir first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA.\n170\nArticle VII\n(2) Notwithstanding Section 2(a)(1) above, in the event that\nProjected BRI for any Salary Cap Year in which one or more\nExpansion Teams is scheduled to play its second Season, plus\nProjected Local Expansion Team BRI for such Salary Cap Year,\nmultiplied by the applicable percentage of Projected BRI set forth in\nSection 2(a)(1) above, less Projected Benefits for such Salary Cap\nYear (including for the Expansion Team(s)), divided by the number\nof Teams scheduled to play in the NBA during such Salary Cap Year\n(including the Expansion Team(s)), exceeds the Salary Cap\ncalculated in accordance with Section 2(a)(1) above, the Salary Cap\nshall equal the amount calculated pursuant to this Section 2(a)(2).\n(3) In the event that the Salary Cap for a Salary Cap Year is\ncalculated based upon an Interim Audit Report for the prior Salary\nCap Year in accordance with Section 2(a)(7) below and BRI and\nTotal Salaries and Benefits as set forth in the Audit Report for the\nprior Salary Cap Year are different from those in the Interim Audit\nReport such that the Salary Cap would have been different from that\nbased upon the Interim Audit Report, any such difference in the\nSalary Cap shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, to the\nSalary Cap for the subsequent Salary Cap Year, except that, with\nrespect to the 2029-30 Salary Cap Year (or, in the alternative, if either\nthe NBA or Players Association exercises its option to terminate this\nAgreement pursuant to Article XXXIX, the 2028-29 Salary Cap\nYear) any such differences shall be debited or credited, as the case\nmay be, to the Salary Cap for the then current Salary Cap Year, in all\nsuch cases with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury\nBill rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the\nissuance of the Interim Audit Report).\n(4) For each Salary Cap Year covered by the term of this\nAgreement, there shall be:\n(i)\na Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety percent (90%) of\nthe Salary Cap for such Salary Cap Year;\n(ii)\na “Tax Level” equal to one hundred twenty-one and one-half\npercent (121.5%) of the Salary Cap for such Salary Cap Year;\nArticle VII\n(iii)\n171\na “First Apron Level” and a “Second Apron Level” as\nfollows:\n(A)\nFor the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, the First Apron\nLevel shall equal the sum of: (1) the Tax Level for\nthe 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, and (2) $6.716 million\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is\nthe average of the Salary Cap for the 2022-23 Salary\nCap Year and the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary\nCap Year, and the denominator of which is the\nSalary Cap for the 2022-23 Salary Cap Year. For\neach subsequent Salary Cap Year, the First Apron\nLevel shall equal the First Apron Level for the\n2023-24 Salary Cap Year multiplied by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the Salary Cap for the\napplicable Salary Cap Year and the denominator of\nwhich is the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap\nYear.\n(B)\nFor the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, the Second Apron\nLevel shall equal the sum of: (1) the Tax Level for\nthe 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, and (2) $17.5 million.\nFor each subsequent Salary Cap Year, the Second\nApron Level shall equal the Second Apron Level for\nthe 2023-24 Salary Cap Year multiplied by a fraction,\nthe numerator of which is the Salary Cap for the\napplicable Salary Cap Year and the denominator of\nwhich is the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap\nYear.\nFor clarity, for purposes of the foregoing calculations, the Salary Cap\nshall be the Salary Cap as calculated in accordance with\nSections 2(a)(1)-(3) above without regard to Sections 2(a)(5) and (6)\nbelow.\nFor example, assume the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year is\n$134 million, for the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year is $140.7 million, and for the\n2025-26 Salary Cap Year is $147.735 million (and that no adjustments\npursuant to Section 2(a)(5) below are required in any of those years).\n172\nArticle VII\nFor the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year:\n•\n•\n•\nThe Tax Level would be $162.81 million (i.e., $134 million (the\n2023-24 Salary Cap) multiplied by 121.5%);\nThe First Apron Level would be $169.807 million (i.e.,\n$162.81 million (the 2023-24 Tax Level) plus an amount equal to\n$6.716 million multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is\n$128.828 million (the average of the 2022-23 Salary Cap of\n$123.655 million and the 2023-24 Salary Cap of $134 million), and\nthe denominator of which is $123.655 million (the 2022-23 Salary\nCap)); and\nThe Second Apron Level would be $180.31 million (i.e.,\n$162.81 million (the 2023-24 Tax Level) plus $17.5 million).\nFor the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year:\n•\n•\n•\nThe Tax Level would be $170.951 million (i.e., $140.7 million\nmultiplied by 121.5%);\nThe First Apron Level would be $178.297 million (i.e.,\n$169.807 million (the 2023-24 First Apron Level) multiplied by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is $140.7 million (the 2024-25\nSalary Cap) and the denominator of which is $134 million (the\n2023-24 Salary Cap)); and\nThe Second Apron Level would be $189.326 million (i.e., $180.31\nmillion (the 2023-24 Second Apron Level) multiplied by a fraction,\nthe numerator of which is $140.7 million (the 2024-25 Salary Cap)\nand the denominator of which is $134 million (the 2023-24 Salary\nCap)).\nFor the 2025-26 Salary Cap Year:\n•\n•\nThe Tax Level would be $179.498 million (i.e., $147.735 million\nmultiplied by 121.5%);\nThe First Apron Level would be $187.212 million (i.e., $169.807\nmillion (the 2023-24 First Apron Level) multiplied by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is $147.735 million (the 2025-26 Salary Cap)\nand the denominator of which is $134 million (the 2023-24 Salary\nCap)); and\nArticle VII\n•\n173\nThe Second Apron Level would be $198.792 million (i.e., $180.31\nmillion (the 2023-24 Second Apron Level) multiplied by a fraction,\nthe numerator of which is $147.735 (the 2025-26 Salary Cap) and\nthe denominator of which is $134 million (the 2023-24 Salary Cap)).\n(5) (i) For each Salary Cap Year beginning with the 2023-24 Salary\nCap Year, in the event that (A) there is a Shortfall Amount (as\ndefined in Section 12(a)(21) below) for such Salary Cap Year,\nand (B) the Carryover Amount (as defined in Section 12(a)(12)\nbelow) in respect of the subsequent Salary Cap Year is equal to\nzero (0), then the Salary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level,\nFirst Apron Level, and Second Apron Level for such\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year (as calculated in accordance with\nSections 2(a)(1)-(4) above) shall each be increased by an amount\nequal to the Shortfall Amount divided by the number of Teams\nin the NBA during such subsequent Salary Cap Year (other\nthan Expansion Teams in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in\nthe NBA).\n(ii) For each Salary Cap Year beginning with the 2023-24 Salary\nCap Year, in the event that there is an Overage Amount (as\ndefined in Section 12(a)(20) below) for such Salary Cap Year\nthat exceeds six percent (6%) of Total Salaries and Benefits,\nthen the Salary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First\nApron Level, and Second Apron Level for the subsequent\nSalary Cap Year (as calculated in accordance with Sections\n2(a)(1)-(4) above) shall each be reduced by an amount\ncalculated as follows:\nSTEP 1: Subtract six percent (6%) of Total Salaries and\nBenefits from the Overage Amount.\nSTEP 2: If Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap\nYear does not exceed BRI for the Salary Cap Year\nby more than eight percent (8%) of BRI for the\nSalary Cap Year or the Overage Amount described\nabove exceeds nine percent (9%) of Total Salaries\nand Benefits, then divide the result of Step 1 by the\nnumber of Teams in the NBA during the\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year (other than Expansion\n174\nArticle VII\nTeams in their first two (2) Salary Cap Years in the\nNBA). The result of this calculation is the amount\nof the reduction in each of the Salary Cap,\nMinimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron\nLevel, and Second Apron Level for such\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further steps\nare required.\nIf Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap\nYear exceeds one hundred eight percent (108%) of\nBRI for the Salary Cap Year and the Overage\nAmount described above does not exceed nine\npercent (9%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then\nproceed to Step 3.\nSTEP 3: Subtract one hundred eight percent (108%) of BRI\nfor the Salary Cap Year from Projected BRI for the\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year.\nSTEP 4: Multiply the result of Step 3 by fifty percent (50%).\nSTEP 5: Subtract the result of Step 4 from the result of\nStep 1. If the result of this step is less than\nzero (0), then no adjustments shall be made to the\nSalary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level,\nFirst Apron Level, or Second Apron Level for the\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further steps\nare required.\nSTEP 6: Divide the result of Step 5 by the number of\nTeams in the NBA during such subsequent Salary\nCap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their\nfirst two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The\nresult of this calculation is the amount of the\nreduction in each of the Salary Cap, Minimum\nTeam Salary, Tax Level, First Apron Level, and\nSecond Apron Level for such subsequent Salary\nCap Year.\nArticle VII\n175\nExample: Assume: (i) 2024-25 Total Salaries and Benefits is $5.5 billion, the\n2024-25 Designated Share is $5.1 billion, and the resulting 2024-25 Overage\nAmount is $400 million (which equals approximately 7.3% of Total Salaries\nand Benefits); (ii) 2025-26 Projected BRI is $10.5 billion, 2024-25 BRI is\n$10 billion, and thus 2025-26 Projected BRI exceeds 2024-25 BRI by 5%;\nand (iii) there are 30 Teams in the NBA in the 2025-26 Season. The 202526 Salary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron Level, and\nSecond Apron Level would each be reduced by $2,333,333 (i.e., $70 million\n(i.e., 2024-25 Overage Amount of $400 million less $330 million (i.e., 6% of\n2024-25 Total Salaries and Benefits) divided by 30 (i.e., the number of Teams\nin the NBA during the 2025-26 Season)).\nExample: Same assumptions as in the prior example, except assume 2025-26\nProjected BRI is $10.9 billion (instead of $10.5 billion), and thus 2025-26\nProjected BRI exceeds 2024-25 BRI by 9%. The 2025-26 Salary Cap,\nMinimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron Level, and Second Apron\nLevel would each be reduced by $666,667 (i.e., the difference between the $70\nmillion from the prior example and $50 million (i.e., 50% of $100 million (i.e.,\n2025-26 Projected BRI of $10.9 billion less $10.8 billion (i.e., 108% of 202425 BRI of $10 billion)) divided by 30 (i.e., the number of Teams in the NBA\nduring the 2025-26 Season))).\n(6) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 2(a)(1)-(5)\nabove, in no event shall any of the Salary Cap, Minimum Team\nSalary, Tax Level, First Apron Level, or Second Apron Level for a\nSalary Cap Year (a) decrease to an amount that is less than its\namount for the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year, or\n(b) increase to an amount that exceeds one hundred ten percent\n(110%) of its amount for the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year.\n(7) In the event that the Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year has\nnot been completed as of the last day of such Salary Cap Year, and\nthe NBA and the Players Association have not reached an agreement\non Projected BRI and Projected Benefits pursuant to Article VII,\nSection 1 and Article IV, Section 8 for the immediately following\nSalary Cap Year, then the Salary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax\nLevel, First Apron Level, and Second Apron Level for the\nimmediately following Salary Cap Year will be calculated pursuant\nto Sections 2(a)(1)-(6) above, except that Interim Projected BRI shall\nbe utilized instead of Projected BRI, Estimated BRI shall be utilized\n176\nArticle VII\ninstead of BRI, and Estimated Total Salaries and Benefits shall be\nutilized instead of Total Salaries and Benefits. In the event that the\nInterim Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year has not been completed\nas of the last day of such Salary Cap Year, and the NBA and Players\nAssociation have not reached agreement on Projected BRI and\nProjected Benefits pursuant to Article VII, Section 1 and Article IV,\nSection 8, then the Salary Cap for the immediately following Salary\nCap Year shall, until such Interim Audit Report is completed, be an\namount that would have been the Salary Cap for the preceding Salary\nCap Year had Projected BRI or Interim Projected BRI, as the case\nmay be, for such preceding Salary Cap Year included, with respect\nto the NBA’s national broadcast, national telecast, or network cable\ntelevision contracts, the rights fees or other non-contingent\npayments stated in such contracts for the Season following the\nSeason covered by such preceding Salary Cap Year instead of for the\nSeason covered by such preceding Salary Cap Year.\n(8) The Salary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron\nLevel, and Second Apron Level for a Salary Cap Year will be in effect\ncommencing on the first day of the Salary Cap Year and shall\ncontinue through and including the last day of the Salary Cap Year.\n(b) Operation of Salary Cap.\n(1) Basic Rule. A Team’s Team Salary may not exceed the Salary\nCap at any time unless the Team is using one of the Exceptions set\nforth in Section 6 below.\n(2) Room. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,\nincluding, without limitation, Article II, Section 7, any Team with\nRoom may enter into a Player Contract that calls for a Salary in the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by such Contract that would not\nexceed the Team’s then-current Room.\n(c) Operation of Minimum Team Salary.\n(1) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the\nfollowing meanings:\n(i)\n“MTS Cap Hold Team Salary” means, for a Team for a\nSalary Cap Year, the Team’s Team Salary calculated in the\nArticle VII\n177\nsame manner as Team Salary is calculated by the\nAccountants for purposes of computing Total Salaries and\nBenefits in the Audit Report (as defined in Section 10(a)(1)\nbelow).\n(ii)\n(iii)\n“MTS Payment Team Salary” means, for a Team for a Salary\nCap Year, the Team’s MTS Cap Hold Team Salary as of the\nstart of the first day of the Regular Season occurring within\nsuch Salary Cap Year:\n(A)\nplus any Salary in respect of such Salary Cap Year\nthat is excluded from the Team’s Team Salary\npursuant to Section 4(h) below;\n(B)\nminus any Salary in respect of such Salary Cap Year\nthat is included in the Team’s Team Salary pursuant\nto Section 3(e) below; and\n(C)\nplus any Salary in respect of such Salary Cap Year\nthat is excluded from the Team’s Team Salary\npursuant to Section 4(b) below.\n“MTS Threshold” means, for a Team for a Salary Cap Year,\nthe lesser of (A) the Minimum Team Salary for such Salary\nCap Year, and (B) such Team’s MTS Cap Hold Team Salary\nas of the start of the first day of the Regular Season occurring\nwithin such Salary Cap Year.\n(2) In the event that a Team’s MTS Payment Team Salary for a\nSalary Cap Year is less than the applicable Minimum Team Salary\nfor that Salary Cap Year, then:\n(i)\nThe NBA shall cause such Team to make a payment to the\nNBA equal to the difference between the Team’s MTS\nPayment Team Salary and the Minimum Team Salary; and\n(ii)\nSubject to Section 2(c)(7) below, and notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in Section 2(d) below, such Team\nshall be prohibited from receiving a share of any tax amount\nthat the NBA elects to distribute to non-taxpaying Teams in\n178\nArticle VII\nrespect of such Salary\nSection 2(d)(4)(i) below.\nCap\nYear\npursuant\nto\n(3) Beginning at the start of the first day of the Regular Season and\ncontinuing through the end of the Salary Cap Year encompassing\nsuch Regular Season, a Team’s Team Salary shall include an amount\nequal to the amount (if any) by which the Minimum Team Salary\nexceeds the lesser of such Team’s (i) then-current MTS Cap Hold\nTeam Salary, and (ii) MTS Cap Hold Team Salary as of the start of\nthe first day of the Regular Season.\n(4) If, on a day during the Regular Season, a Team’s MTS Cap Hold\nTeam Salary decreases to an amount that is less than its MTS\nThreshold, then the Team will be required to increase its MTS Cap\nHold Team Salary to an amount equal to or greater than its MTS\nThreshold by the end of the immediately following day.\n(5) If, as of the end of the last day of a Salary Cap Year, the\nMinimum Team Salary for such Salary Cap Year exceeds the portion\nof total MTS Cap Hold Team Salaries for which a Team is financially\nresponsible plus any payment that the Team is required to make\npursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(i) above, then, in addition to any\npayment required pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(i) above, such Team\nshall make a payment to the NBA equal to the amount of such\nexcess. For the purposes of this Section 2(c)(5), MTS Cap Hold\nTeam Salaries shall:\n(i)\ninclude any Incentive Compensation excluded from Salaries\nin accordance with Article VII, Section 3(d) but actually\nearned by players during such Salary Cap Year; and\n(ii)\nexclude all Incentive Compensation included in Salaries in\naccordance with Article VII, Section 3(d) but not actually\nearned by players during such Salary Cap Year.\n(6) Any payment due by a Team in respect of a Salary Cap Year\npursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(i) or 2(c)(5) above shall be made by the\nTeam to the NBA no later than ten (10) business days following the\ncompletion of the Governing Audit Report for such Salary Cap\nYear. The NBA shall then distribute any such payments equally to\nArticle VII\n179\neach Team within ten (10) business days following its receipt of such\npayments.\n(7) Notwithstanding Section 2(c)(2)(ii) above, for the 2023-24\nSalary Cap Year only, if (i) a Team’s MTS Payment Team Salary for\nthe 2023-24 Salary Cap Year is less than the Minimum Team Salary\nfor such Salary Cap Year, and (ii) such Team does not owe a Tax for\nsuch Salary Cap Year, then such Team shall be entitled to receive a\nfifty percent (50%) share of any tax amount that the NBA elects to\ndistribute to non-taxpaying Teams in respect of such Salary Cap\nYear pursuant to Section 2(d)(4)(i) below. For example, if there were\ntwenty-four (24) non-taxpaying Teams for the 2023-24 Salary Cap\nYear and one (1) of such Teams had a MTS Payment Team Salary\nfor such Salary Cap Year less than the Minimum Team Salary, then\nsuch Team, rather than receiving one-twenty-fourth (1/24th) of the\ntotal amount that the NBA elects to distribute to non-taxpaying\nTeams pursuant to Section 2(d)(4)(i) below, would instead receive a\nTax distribution amount equal to the total amount to be distributed\nto non-taxpaying Teams multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is one-half (0.5) and the denominator of which is twenty-three\nand one-half (0.5/23.5). Each of the other twenty-three (23)\nnon-taxpaying Teams for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year would receive\na Tax distribution amount equal to the total amount to be distributed\nto non-taxpaying Teams multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is one (1) and the denominator of which is twenty-three and\none-half (1/23.5).\n(8) Nothing contained herein shall preclude a Team from having a\nTeam Salary in excess of the Minimum Team Salary, provided that\nthe Team’s Team Salary does not exceed the Salary Cap plus any\nadditional amounts authorized pursuant to the Exceptions set forth\nin this Article VII.\n(d) Operation of Tax Level.\n(1) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the\nfollowing meanings:\n(i)\n“Tax Team Salary” means, for a Team for a Salary Cap Year,\nthe Team’s Team Salary as of the start of its last Regular\n180\nArticle VII\nSeason game occurring within such Salary Cap Year,\ncalculated by the Accountants in the same manner as Team\nSalary is calculated by the Accountants for purposes of\ncomputing Total Salaries and Benefits in the Audit Report:\n(A)\nplus all Incentive Compensation excluded from\nSalary under Section 3(d) below but actually earned\nby the player during such Salary Cap Year;\n(B)\nminus all Incentive Compensation included in Salary\nunder Section 3(d) below but not actually earned by\nthe player during such Salary Cap Year;\n(C)\nplus, with respect to any trade that occurs following\nthe conclusion of the Team’s last Regular Season\ngame, the portion of any trade bonus earned by a\nplayer that is included in the Team’s Team Salary for\nsuch Salary Cap Year;\n(D)\nplus any amount that is added to the Team’s Team\nSalary for such Salary Cap Year following the start\nof the Team’s last Regular Season game pursuant to\nSection 4(a)(1)(iii) below;\n(E)\nminus fifty percent (50%) of any reduction made to\na player’s Compensation as a result of a suspension\nby the NBA (but not by a Team); and\n(F)\nplus, with respect to a Standard NBA Contract\nbetween a Team and a Free Agent with zero (0)\nYears of Service or one (1) Year of Service, the\namount (if any) by which (x) the Minimum Player\nSalary that would be applicable to a player with two\n(2) Years of Service as set forth in the Minimum\nAnnual Salary Scale for the Salary Cap Year in which\nsuch Free Agent was signed (or in the event such\nFree Agent’s Contract is terminated during the\nRegular Season, the Minimum Player Salary that\nwould be applicable to a player with two (2) Years of\nService as set forth in the Minimum Annual Salary\nArticle VII\n181\nScale for the Salary Cap Year in which such Free\nAgent was signed, reduced pro rata to reflect the\nplayer’s post-termination Salary), exceeds (y) the\nSalary attributable to such Standard NBA Contract.\nFor the purposes of this Section 2(d)(1)(i)(F):\n(ii)\n(1)\na Standard NBA Contract between a Team\nand a Two-Way Player (either signed\npursuant to Article II, Section 11(h), or the\nresult of the exercise of a Standard NBA\nContract Conversion Option) will be\ndeemed to be a “Standard NBA Contract\nbetween a Team and a Free Agent” provided\nthat such Two-Way Player’s Two-Way\nContract was: (i) signed by the player as a\nFree Agent; or (ii) the result of the exercise\nof the Two-Way Player Conversion Option\nprovided for in the Exhibit 10 of a Contract\nthat he signed as a Free Agent; and\n(2)\na Standard NBA Contract between a Team\nand a player under a 10-Day Contract\n(signed pursuant to Article II, Section 9(g))\nwill be deemed to be a Standard NBA\nContract between a Team and a Free Agent\nprovided that such 10-Day Contract was\nsigned by the player as a Free Agent.\n“Tax Bracket Amount” means, for a Salary Cap Year, an\namount equal to $5 million multiplied by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the Salary Cap for such Salary Cap\nYear and the denominator of which is the Salary Cap for the\n2023-24 Salary Cap Year.\nFor example, assume the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap\nYear is $134 million and the Salary Cap for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear is $140.7 million. The Tax Bracket Amount for the 2023-24\nSalary Cap Year would be $5 million (i.e., $5 million multiplied by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is $134 million and the denominator\nof which is $134 million), and the Tax Bracket Amount for the\n182\nArticle VII\n2024-25 Salary Cap Year would be $5.25 million (i.e., $5 million\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is $140.7 million (the\n2024-25 Salary Cap) and the denominator of which is $134 million\n(the 2023-24 Salary Cap)).\n(2) Each Team whose Tax Team Salary exceeds the Tax Level for\nany Salary Cap Year shall be required to pay a tax to the NBA. For\neach Salary Cap Year, the tax shall be calculated: (A) using the\napplicable rates in Section 2(d)(2)(i) (“Standard Tax Rates”) for any\nTeam whose Tax Team Salary did not exceed the Tax Level in three\n(3) or more of the four (4) Salary Cap Years immediately preceding\nsuch Salary Cap Year; and (B) using the applicable rates shown in\nSection 2(d)(2)(ii) (“Repeater Tax Rates”) for any Team whose Tax\nTeam Salary exceeded the Tax Level in three (3) or more of the four\n(4) Salary Cap Years immediately preceding such Salary Cap Year.\nArticle VII\n(i)\n183\nStandard Tax Rates:\nTax Rate for Increment\nIncremental Team\nSalary Above\nTax Level\n$0 – 100% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n100% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nand Over\n2023-24 and 2024-25\nSalary Cap Years\nBeginning with\n2025-26 Salary Cap\nYear\n$1.50-for-$1\n$1.00-for-$1\n$1.75-for-$1\n$1.25-for-$1\n$2.50-for-$1\n$3.50-for-$1\n$3.25-for-$1\n$4.75-for-$1\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$3.75-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$5.25-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\n184\nArticle VII\n(ii)\nRepeater Tax Rates:\nTax Rate for Increment\nIncremental Team\nSalary Above\nTax Level\n$0 – 100% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n100% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nand Over\n2023-24 and 2024-25\nSalary Cap Years\nBeginning with\n2025-26 Salary Cap\nYear\n$2.50-for-$1\n$3.00-for-$1\n$2.75-for-$1\n$3.25-for-$1\n$3.50-for-$1\n$5.50-for-$1\n$4.25-for-$1\n$6.75-for-$1\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$4.75-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$7.25-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\nExample: In respect of the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, the Tax\nBracket Amount is $5 million. Assume that Team A is subject to\nthe Standard Tax Rates, and Team A has a Tax Team Salary that\nArticle VII\n185\nexceeds the Tax Level by $15 million. Team A would pay a Tax of\n$28.75 million (i.e., $5 million times $1.50, plus $5 million times\n$1.75, plus $5 million times $2.50).\nExample: Assume that, in respect of the 2025-26 Salary Cap Year,\nthe Tax Bracket Amount is $6 million, Team B is subject to the\nStandard Tax Rates, and Team B has a Tax Team Salary that\nexceeds the Tax Level by $15 million. Team B would pay a Tax of\n$24 million (i.e., $6 million times $1.00, plus $6 million times $1.25,\nplus $3 million times $3.50).\nExample: Assume that, in respect of the 2026-27 Salary Cap Year,\nthe Tax Bracket Amount is $6.5 million, Team C is subject to the\nRepeater Tax Rates, and Team C has a Tax Team Salary that\nexceeds the Tax Level by $15 million. Team C would pay a Tax of\n$51.625 million (i.e., $6.5 million times $3.00, plus $6.5 million\ntimes $3.25, plus $2 million times $5.50).\n(3) Each Team that owes a tax in respect of a Salary Cap Year shall\nmake the required tax payment to the NBA no later than ten (10)\nbusiness days following the completion of the Governing Audit\nReport for such Salary Cap Year.\n(4) All amounts remitted to the NBA by NBA Teams pursuant to\nthis Section 2(d) shall be the exclusive property of the NBA, and\nsuch amounts shall be used and/or distributed as follows:\n(i)\nSubject to Sections 2(c)(2)(ii) and 2(c)(7) above, the NBA\nmay elect to distribute up to fifty percent (50%) of such\namounts to one (1) or more Teams based in whole or in part\non the fact that such Team(s) did not owe a tax for such\nSalary Cap Year (e.g., subject to Sections 2(c)(2)(ii) and\n2(c)(7) above, the NBA could elect to distribute fifty percent\n(50%) of such amounts in equal shares to all non-taxpayers\nin such Salary Cap Year); and\n(ii)\namounts\nnot distributed\nin\naccordance with\nSection 2(d)(4)(i) above shall be used for one (1) or more\n“League purposes” (as defined below) selected by the NBA.\n186\nArticle VII\nFor purposes of this Section 2(d)(4), the use of tax amounts for a\n“League purpose” shall mean the use of such amounts for any\npurpose, including, but not limited to, the distribution of such\namounts to one (1) or more Teams; provided, however, that such\namounts may not be distributed to a Team or expended for the\nbenefit or detriment of a Team in a manner that is based, directly or\nindirectly, in whole or in part, on the amount of the Team’s Team\nSalary or on whether the Team is a taxpayer.

On July 9, 2024, having not previously engaged (x) in any of the\ntransactions set forth in rows E through J of the Transaction Restrictions\nTable at any point from the day following the last day of the 2023-24\nRegular Season through the end of 2023-24 Salary Cap Year or (y) in any\nof the transactions set forth in the Transactions Restrictions Table at any\npoint during the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year, Team D seeks to acquire by\ntrade a player using the Aggregated Standard Traded Player Exception.\nImmediately following such trade, Team D’s 2024-25 Apron Team Salary\nwould be $195 million. The proposed trade (a transaction set forth in\nrow H of the Transaction Restrictions Table with an Applicable Apron\nLevel of the Second Apron Level) is prohibited by Section 2(e)(2)(i)(A)\nabove because, immediately following the trade, Team D’s 2024-25 Apron\nTeam Salary would exceed $189.5 million (i.e., the 2024-25 Second\nApron Level).\n5. On June 22, 2024 (after the conclusion of the 2023-24 Regular Season in\nApril 2024), having not previously engaged in any of the transactions set\nforth in rows A through E of the Transaction Restrictions Table at any\npoint during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, Team E acquires by trade a\nPlayer Contract using the Transition Traded Player Exception.\nArticle VII\n195\nImmediately following such trade, Team E’s 2023-24 Apron Team Salary\nis $175 million, and Team E’s 2024-25 Apron Team Salary (calculated\nin accordance with Section 2(e)(3)(i) above) is $168 million. Such trade (a\ntransaction set forth in row G of the Transaction Restrictions Table with\nan Applicable Apron Level of the First Apron Level): (a) is not prohibited\nby Section 2(e)(2)(i)(B) above because Team E had not previously engaged\nin any of the transactions set forth in rows A through E of the Transaction\nRestrictions Table at any point during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year (i.e.,\ntransactions that would have prohibited Team E from having an Apron\nTeam Salary that exceeds the First Apron Level in the 2023-24 Salary\nCap Year); (b) is not prohibited by Section 2(e)(2)(i)(A) above because,\nnotwithstanding that Team E’s 2023-24 Apron Team Salary exceeds\n$170 million (i.e., the 2023-24 First Apron Level), pursuant to\nSection 2(e)(5) above, a Team that uses the Transition Traded Player\nException to acquire a player during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year will\nnot by virtue of using such Traded Player Exception be prohibited from\nhaving a 2023-24 Apron Team Salary that exceeds the 2023-24 First\nApron Level; and (c) is not prohibited by Section 2(e)(2)(ii)(A) above\nbecause, immediately following such trade, Team E’s 2024-25 Apron\nTeam Salary (calculated in accordance with Section 2(e)(3)(i) above) is less\nthan or equal to $170 million (i.e., the assumed 2024-25 First Apron\nLevel as calculated in accordance with Section 2(e)(3)(ii) above). As a result\nof the trade, pursuant to Section 2(e)(2)(ii)(B) above: (i) for the remainder\nof the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, Team E may not have a 2024-25\nApron Team Salary (calculated in accordance with Section 2(e)(3)(i) above)\nthat exceeds $170 million (i.e., the assumed 2024-25 First Apron Level);\nand (ii) for the entirety of the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year, Team E may not\nhave a 2024-25 Apron Team Salary that exceeds $178.5 million (i.e., the\n2024-25 First Apron Level).\n(f) Draft Pick Penalty.\n(1) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the\nfollowing meanings:\n(i)\n“Second Apron Team” means, for a Salary Cap Year, a Team\nthat, as of the start of the Team’s last Regular Season game\noccurring within such Salary Cap Year, has an Apron Team\nSalary for such Salary Cap Year that exceeds the Second\nApron Level for such Salary Cap Year.\n196\nArticle VII\n(ii)\n“Draft Pick Penalty” means, for a Team’s first round draft\npick, that such draft pick shall be the final draft pick in the\nfirst round of the applicable NBA Draft (regardless of the\nposition in the first round of the Draft at which the Team\notherwise would have selected pursuant to NBA rules\ngoverning the order of selection by Teams in the Draft);\nprovided, however, that, if multiple Teams’ first round draft\npicks are each subject to a Draft Pick Penalty in respect of\nthe same NBA Draft, then the Teams with such first round\ndraft picks shall select in the inverse order of their winning\npercentage for the Regular Season immediately preceding\nsuch NBA Draft (with priority in selection among any such\nTeams tied on a winning percentage basis established\npursuant to NBA rules governing the order of selection by\nTeams in the Draft). For example, if Team A’s and Team\nB’s first round draft picks in the 2032 NBA Draft are each\nsubject to a Draft Pick Penalty, and Team A finished with a\nbetter winning percentage than Team B for the 2031-32\nRegular Season, then Team A would make the final selection\nin the first round of the 2032 NBA Draft and Team B would\nmake the immediately preceding selection.\n(2) Beginning with the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year, if a Team is a\nSecond Apron Team for a Salary Cap Year, then:\n(i)\nthe Team shall be prohibited from trading (either\nconditionally or unconditionally) its first round draft pick in\nthe first NBA Draft that occurs following the seventh\nSeason that follows the Season occurring within such Salary\nCap Year; and\n(ii)\nwith respect to the four (4) Salary Cap Years immediately\nfollowing such Salary Cap Year:\n(A)\nIf the Team is a Second Apron Team for two (2) or\nmore of such four (4) Salary Cap Years, then such\nfirst round draft pick shall be subject to a Draft Pick\nPenalty; and\nArticle VII\n(B)\n197\nIf the Team is a Second Apron Team for fewer than\ntwo (2) of such four (4) Salary Cap Years, then, as of\nthe day following the last day of the Regular Season\nencompassed by the third of such four (4) Salary Cap\nYears in which the Team is not a Second Apron\nTeam, such Team shall be permitted to trade\n(conditionally or unconditionally) such first round\ndraft pick. For clarity, such first round draft pick\nshall not be subject to a Draft Pick Penalty.\nExample: If Team A is a Second Apron Team for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear, then it would be prohibited from trading its 2032 first round draft pick\n(i.e., its first round draft pick in the first NBA Draft that occurs following the\nseventh Season that follows the Season occurring within such Salary Cap Year).\nIf Team A is also a Second Apron Team for the 2025-26 and 2028-29 Salary\nCap Years, then Team A’s 2032 first round draft pick would be subject to a\nDraft Pick Penalty.\nExample: If Team B is a Second Apron Team for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear, then it would be prohibited from trading its 2032 first round draft pick.\nIf Team B is not a Second Apron Team in the 2025-26, 2026-27, and\n2027-28 Salary Cap Years, then Team B would be permitted to trade its 2032\nfirst round draft pick as of the day following the last day of the 2027-28 Regular\nSeason (and such first round draft pick would not be subject to a Draft Pick\nPenalty).\n(g) Expansion Team Salary Caps, Minimum Team Salaries, Tax\nLevels, and Apron Levels. Each Expansion Team shall have the same\nSalary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron Level, and\nSecond Apron Level as all other Teams, except as follows:\n(1) During the first Salary Cap Year in which it begins play, an\nExpansion Team shall have a Salary Cap equal to sixty-six and\ntwo-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the Salary Cap calculated pursuant\nto Section 2(a) above (the “First Year Expansion Team Salary Cap”);\nand shall have a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety percent\n(90%) of the First Year Expansion Team Salary Cap.\n(2) During the Salary Cap Year immediately following the Salary\nCap Year in which it begins play, an Expansion Team shall have a\n198\nArticle VII\nSalary Cap equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Salary Cap calculated\npursuant to Section 2(a) above (the “Second Year Expansion Team\nSalary Cap”); and shall have a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety\npercent (90%) of the Second Year Expansion Team Salary Cap."

In the event that, at the time of\nthe allocation, none of the Base Compensation provided for\nduring the extended term is protected for lack of skill, then\nthe entire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to\nthe first Salary Cap Year of the extended term.\n(ii)\nA Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may enter\ninto an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus\nto be paid at any time during the Contract’s original or\nextended term. In the event that a Team with a Team Salary\nbelow the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for\nor contains a signing bonus to be paid no sooner than the\nfirst day of the Salary Cap Year covered by such extended\nterm, the bonus shall be allocated in accordance with the\nproration rules set forth in Section 3(b)(3)(i) above. In the\nevent a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap enters\ninto an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus\nto be paid prior to the first day of the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term, the following rules shall\napply:\n202\nArticle VII\n(A)\nThe signing bonus shall be allocated over the\nremaining Salary Cap Years (including the\nthen-current Salary Cap Year) under the original\nterm of the Contract and the extended term in\nproportion to the percentage of Base Compensation\nin each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of\nallocation, is protected for lack of skill. In the event\nthat, at the time of allocation, none of the Base\nCompensation provided for during the then-current\nand any remaining Salary Cap Years under the\noriginal term of the Contract or during the extended\nterm is protected for lack of skill, then the entire\namount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the\nSalary Cap Year during which the Extension is\nsigned; and\n(B)\nThe Extension shall be deemed a Renegotiation and\nshall be subject to the rules governing\nRenegotiations set forth in Section 7 below; and\n(C)\nNotwithstanding Article II, Section 3(b), the\nExhibit 1 of such Extension must provide that the\nsigning bonus shall be paid in two (2) installments as\nfollows:\n(1)\nthe first installment shall be paid on a\nspecified date prior to the first day of the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term, and shall be for an amount\nequal to the portion of the signing bonus\nthat is allocated to the Salary Cap Year(s)\ncovered by the original term of the Contract;\nand\n(2)\nthe second installment shall be paid on a\nspecified date on or after the first day of the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term, and shall be for an amount\nequal to the portion of the signing bonus\nthat is allocated to the Salary Cap Year(s)\nArticle VII\n203\ncovered by the extended term of the\nContract.\n(iii)\nIf a Team and player enter into an Extension and provide\nthat the trade bonus provision contained in the original\nContract would not be applicable to the extended term in\naccordance with Article XXIV, Section 2(a)(v), then, in the\ncase of an earned signing bonus described in\nSection 3(b)(1)(ii) above, the signing bonus shall be allocated\nover the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Year(s)\ncovered by the original term of the extended Contract (and\nnot any of the Salary Cap Years covered by the extended\nterm) in proportion to the percentage of Base Compensation\nin each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of allocation,\nis protected for lack of skill. In the event that, at the time of\nallocation, none of the then-current or applicable remaining\nBase Compensation is protected for lack of skill, then the\nentire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the\nSalary Cap Year during which the player’s extended Contract\nis traded.\n(iv)\nIf a Team and player enter into an Extension that contains a\ntrade bonus provision that is applicable to the Contract’s\noriginal and extended term, then, in the case of a signing\nbonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above that is earned\nprior to the first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term:\n(A)\nFor purposes of calculating the signing bonus and\nallocating the signing bonus to the applicable Salary\nCap Year(s), the Base Compensation in the extended\nterm of the Contract shall be the Base\nCompensation as set forth in the Contract; provided,\nhowever, that:\n(1)\nIf the Contract provides for Base\nCompensation in the first Salary Cap Year of\nthe extended term that is expressed as a\npercentage of the Salary Cap in accordance\nwith Article II, Section 7(d) or Section 7(e),\n204\nArticle VII\nthen the Base Compensation in the extended\nterm of the Contract shall be determined\nassuming that the Salary Cap will increase by\nfour and one-half percent (4.5%) each Salary\nCap Year beginning with the Salary Cap Year\nfollowing the then-current Salary Cap Year\nand ending with the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term; or\n(2)\n(B)\nIf the Contract provides for Salary plus\nUnlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year\nof the extended term that exceeds the\napplicable Maximum Annual Salary that\nwould apply to such player assuming that\n(a) the player will be credited with a Year of\nService for each remaining year of the\noriginal term of the Contract, and (b) the\nSalary Cap will increase by four and one-half\npercent (4.5%) each Salary Cap Year\nbeginning with the Salary Cap Year\nfollowing the then-current Salary Cap Year\nand ending with the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term, then the Base\nCompensation in the extended term of the\nContract shall be determined to be the Base\nCompensation that would result from the\ndeemed amendment(s) pursuant to\nArticle II, Section 7(c) using the\nassumptions described in clauses (a) and (b)\nof this subsection.\nNotwithstanding the Exhibit 4 to such Contract, the\nsigning bonus shall be paid in two (2) installments as\nfollows:\n(1)\nThe first installment shall be paid within\nthirty (30) days of the date of the trade to\nwhich the bonus applies, and shall be for an\namount equal to the portion of the signing\nbonus that is allocated to the Salary Cap\nArticle VII\n205\nYear(s) covered by the original term of the\nContract; and\n(2)\n(v)\nThe second installment shall be paid within\nthirty (30) days of the first day of the first\nSalary Cap Year covered by the extended\nterm, and shall be for an amount equal to the\nportion of the signing bonus that is allocated\nto the Salary Cap Year(s) covered by the\nextended term of the Contract.\nIn the event that a team is required to make signing bonus\npayment(s) pursuant to Section 3(b)(3)(i), 3(b)(3)(ii)(C), or\n3(b)(3)(iv) above, and the amount(s) of the signing bonus\nallocation in respect of such signing bonus are deemed\namended pursuant to Article II, Section 7(c), then the\namount of the payment required pursuant to\nSection 3(b)(3)(i), 3(b)(3)(ii)(C)(2), or 3(b)(3)(iv)(B)(2) above\nshall be reduced to equal the sum of the signing bonus\nallocation amount(s) that result from the deemed\namendment(s) pursuant to Article II, Section 7(c).\n(c) Loans to Players. The following rules shall apply to any loan made\nby any Team to a player:\n(1) If any such loan bears no interest (or annual interest at an\neffective rate lower than the “Target Rate” (as defined below)), then\nthe interest shall be imputed on the outstanding balance at a rate\nequal to the difference between the Target Rate and the actual rate\nof interest to be paid by the player and such imputed interest shall\nbe included in the player’s Salary. The “Target Rate” means the\n“Prime Rate” (as defined below) plus one percent (1%) as of the\ndate the loan is agreed upon, except that the “Target Rate” shall be\nno lower than seven percent (7%) or greater than nine percent (9%).\nFor purposes of this Section 3(c)(1), “Prime Rate” means the prime\nrate reported in the “Money Rates” column or any successor column\nof The Wall Street Journal.\n(2) No loan made to a player may (along with other outstanding\nloans to the player) exceed the amount of the player’s Salary for the\n206\nArticle VII\nthen-current Salary Cap Year that is protected for lack of skill. All\nloans must be repaid through deductions from the player’s\nremaining Current Base Compensation over the years of the\nContract that, at the time the loan is agreed upon, provide for Base\nCompensation that is fully protected for lack of skill (prior to the\nEffective Season of any ETO) in equal annual amounts (the “annual\nallocable repayment amounts”). If a loan is made at a time when the\nremaining Current Base Compensation due for the relevant Season\nthat is fully protected for lack of skill is less than the annual allocable\nrepayment amount that would be owed on a loan for the full amount\nof the player’s Current Base Compensation that is fully protected for\nlack of skill for the relevant Season (the “maximum annual allocable\nrepayment amount”), the maximum loan amount for that Season\nshall be reduced by the amount by which the maximum annual\nallocable repayment amount exceeds the amount of remaining\nCurrent Base Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill.\n(For example, if a Player has $2 million in Current Base\nCompensation (fully protected for lack of skill) in the first Season of\na five-year Contract, and a loan is made during that Season at a time\nwhen the Player has already received his Current Base\nCompensation for that Season, the loan may not exceed\n$1.6 million.)\n(3) In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 3(c)(2) above:\n(i) no loan may be made that would result in a violation of Article II,\nSection 13(e); and (ii) no loan may be made to a player whose\nContract provides for Base Compensation equal to the Minimum\nPlayer Salary.\n(4) Any forgiveness by a Team of a loan to a player shall be deemed\na Renegotiation in the Salary Cap Year of such forgiveness and shall\nbe subject to the rules governing Renegotiations set forth in\nSection 7 below.\n(d) Incentive Compensation.\n(1) For purposes of determining a player’s Salary each Salary Cap\nYear, except as provided in Sections 3(d)(2)-(4) below, any\nPerformance Bonus (provided such Performance Bonus may be\nincluded in a Player Contract in accordance with Section 5(b) below),\nArticle VII\n207\nshall be included in Salary only if such Performance Bonus would\nbe earned if the Team’s or player’s performance were identical to the\nperformance in the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year.\n(2) Notwithstanding Section 3(d)(1) above, in the event that, at the\ntime of the signing of a Contract, Renegotiation or Extension, the\nNBA or the Players Association believes that the performance of a\nplayer and/or his Team during the immediately preceding Salary Cap\nYear does not fairly predict the likelihood of the player earning a\nPerformance Bonus during any Salary Cap Year covered by the\nContract, Renegotiation, or extended term of the Extension (as the\ncase may be), the NBA or the Players Association may request that\na jointly selected basketball expert (“Expert”) determine whether\n(i) in the case of an NBA challenge, it is more likely than not that\nthe bonus will be earned, or (ii) in the case of a Players Association\nchallenge, it is very likely that the bonus will not be earned. The\nparty initiating a proceeding before the Expert shall carry the burden\nof proof. The Expert shall conduct a hearing within five (5) business\ndays after the initiation of the proceeding, and shall render a\ndetermination within five (5) business days after the hearing.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(d)(2), no\nparty may, in connection with any proceeding before the Expert,\nrefer to the facts that, absent a challenge pursuant to this\nSection 3(d)(2), a Performance Bonus would or would not be\nincluded in a player’s Salary pursuant to Section 3(d)(1) above, or\nwould be termed “Likely” or “Unlikely” pursuant to Article I,\nSection 1(ff) or (eeee). If, following an NBA challenge, the Expert\ndetermines that a Performance Bonus is more likely than not to be\nearned, the bonus shall be included in the player’s Salary. If,\nfollowing a Players Association challenge, the Expert determines\nthat a Performance Bonus is very likely not to be earned, the bonus\nshall be excluded from the player’s Salary. The Expert’s\ndetermination that a Performance Bonus is more likely than not to\nbe earned or very likely not to be earned shall be final, binding and\nunappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection with\nany proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 3(d)(2) shall be\nborne equally by the parties.\n(3) In the case of a Rookie or a Veteran who did not play during\nthe immediately preceding Salary Cap Year who signs a Contract\n208\nArticle VII\ncontaining a Performance Bonus, or in the case of a player signed or\nacquired by an Expansion Team whose Contract contains a\nPerformance Bonus to be paid as a result of, in whole or in part, the\nplayer’s achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to the\nTeam’s performance during its first Salary Cap Year, such\nPerformance Bonus will be included in Salary if it is likely to be\nearned.

When a player retires and\nthe Team continues to pay such amounts, then, for purposes\nof computing the player’s Salary for the then-current and any\nremaining Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract, the\naggregate of such amounts, notwithstanding the payment\nschedule, shall be allocated pro rata over the then-current\nand each remaining Salary Cap Year on the basis of the\nremaining unearned protected Compensation in each such\nSalary Cap Year at the time of retirement.\n(iii)\nAmounts paid or to be paid pursuant to awards for, or\nsettlements of, Grievances between a player and a Team\nconcerning Compensation obligations under a Player\nContract in accordance with the following rules (which,\nexcept for purposes of Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(C) below, shall be\napplied with respect to each Season for which there is any\nCompensation in dispute, as if the grievance relates only to\nsuch Season):\n(A)\n(1)\nWhen a player initiates a Grievance (as\ndefined in Article XXXI) against a Team\nseeking the payment of Compensation for a\nSeason covered by the current or any future\nSalary Cap Year that the Team asserts is not\nowed, fifty percent (50%) of the disputed\namount shall be included in Team Salary for\nthe Salary Cap Year to which the Grievance\nrelates.

In order to facilitate any such\n214\nArticle VII\nrequired tax refund from the NBA to the\nTeam, the NBA shall set aside, pending\nresolution of the Grievance, the amount of\ntax paid by that Team in the Salary Cap Year\nto which the Grievance relates that is\nattributable to the fifty percent (50%)\nallocation. Following resolution of the\nGrievance, the NBA shall pay to the Team\nthe tax refund to which it is entitled (if any)\nbased upon the resolution of the Grievance,\nand the remainder of the set aside tax funds\nshall be distributed by the NBA to one (1) or\nmore Teams or otherwise used by the\nLeague in such manner as the NBA may\nreasonably determine, consistent with the\nprovisions of Section 2(d)(4) above.\n(B)\nWhen a player initiates a Grievance against a Team\nseeking the payment of Compensation for a Season\ncovered by a prior Salary Cap Year that the Team\nasserts is not owed, following resolution of the\nGrievance, whether by award or settlement, the\ndisputed amount payable by the Team, if any, shall\nbe included in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year\nin which the Grievance is resolved (but only to the\nextent that it had been previously excluded from\nTeam Salary).

If a\nTeam renounces a Veteran Free Agent, the player will no longer\nqualify as a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early Qualifying Veteran\nFree Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, as the case may\nbe, and the Team will only be permitted to re-sign such player with\nRoom (i.e., the Team cannot sign such player pursuant to Section\n6(b) below), pursuant to the Minimum Player Salary Exception, or\nto a Two-Way Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the\nevent a Team renounces one or more players pursuant to this\nSection 6(g) (or, with respect to a First Round Pick, pursuant to\nArticle X, Section 4(g)) in order to create Room for an Offer Sheet,\nand the offeree-player’s Prior Team subsequently matches the Offer\nSheet and enters into a Contract with that player, the Team may\nrescind the renunciation (in the case where a Team renounces only\none player) or all such renunciations (in the case where the Team\nrenounces more than one player) within two (2) business days of the\ndate the Offer Sheet is matched (or, if the Prior Team conditions its\nmatch on the player reporting for and passing a physical, within\n222\nArticle VII\ntwo (2) business days of the player passing the physical), whereupon\nany such “unrenounced” player may again sign a Player Contract\nwith the Team as a First Round Pick, Qualifying Veteran Free Agent,\nEarly Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran\nFree Agent, as the case may be, and will again be included in his\nPrior Team’s Team Salary at his applicable Free Agent Amount;\nprovided, however, that a Team may not rescind the renunciation of\na player if (i) at the time the player was renounced, the Team’s Team\nSalary was at or below the Salary Cap and “unrenouncing” the player\nwould cause the Team’s Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap, or\n(ii) at the time the player was renounced, the Team’s Team Salary\nwas above the Salary Cap and “unrenouncing” the player would\ncause the Team’s Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap by more than\nthe amount by which the Team’s Team Salary exceeded the Salary\nCap prior to the renunciation.\n(2) A Team cannot renounce any player who is a Restricted Free\nAgent.\n(h) Long-Term Injuries. Any player who suffers a career-ending\ninjury or illness, and whose Contract is terminated by the Team in\naccordance with the NBA waiver procedure, will be excluded from his\nTeam’s Team Salary as follows:\n(1) Subject to Section 4(h)(5) below, a Team may apply to the NBA\nto have the player’s Salary for each remaining Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the Contract excluded from Team Salary beginning on\nthe first anniversary of the date of the last Regular Season, Play-In,\nor playoff game in which the player played; provided, however, that\nif the player played in fewer than ten (10) Regular Season, Play-In,\nand playoff games in the last Season in which he played, then the\nearliest date upon which a Team may apply to the NBA to have the\nplayer’s Salary excluded from its Team Salary in accordance with this\nSection 4(h) shall be the later of (A) sixty (60) days following the\ndate during such Season in which the player last played in a Regular\nSeason, Play-In, or playoff game, and (B) the first anniversary of the\ndate during a prior Season in which the player last played in a Regular\nSeason, Play-In, or playoff game under such Contract.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4(h)(1), a\nTeam may not apply to have a player’s Salary excluded from Team\nArticle VII\n223\nSalary prior to the first anniversary of the date of the first Regular\nSeason game that the player is on the Team’s roster under the\nContract in question.\n(2) The determination of whether a player has suffered a\ncareer-ending injury or illness shall be made by a physician selected\njointly by the NBA and the Players Association or, upon agreement\nof the NBA and the Players Association, a Fitness-to-Play Panel\nestablished under Article XXII. A player shall be deemed to have\nsuffered a career-ending injury or illness if it is determined (i) by such\na physician or Fitness-to-Play Panel that the player has an injury or\nillness that (x) prevents him from playing skilled professional\nbasketball at an NBA level for the duration of his career, or\n(y) substantially impairs his ability to play skilled professional\nbasketball at an NBA level and is of such severity that continuing to\nplay professional basketball at an NBA level would subject the player\nto medically unacceptable risk of suffering a life-threatening or\npermanently disabling injury or illness, or (ii) by such Fitness-to-Play\nPanel that the player has an injury or illness that would create a\nmaterially elevated risk of death, paralysis, or other permanent spinal\ninjury for the player under the procedures set forth in Article XXII,"

Should the player consent (or if the player\nand Team agreed at the time of signing to eliminate his right to consent)\nand the player is traded (except if the Contract has an Option for the\nsecond year that was exercised prior to the trade), then, for purposes of\ndetermining whether the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early\nQualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent at\nthe conclusion of the Contract or any subsequent Contract between the\nplayer and the assignee Team, the player shall be considered as having\nchanged Teams by means of signing a Contract with the assignee Team as\nArticle VII\n261\na Free Agent (and not by means of trade).

If a team acquires\na player in a trade, then, for a period of six (6) months\nfollowing the date of the trade, the team may not enter into\n(X) an Extension with the player pursuant to Section 7(a)\nabove that covers five (5) Seasons (or, if the trade occurred\nprior to the first day of the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year,\nfour (4) or more Seasons) and/or provides for Salary and\nUnlikely Bonuses or annual increases or decreases in the\nplayer’s Salary and/or Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the\namounts that, at the time such trade occurred, were\npermissible in Extensions entered into in connection with\nan agreement to trade the Contract pursuant to\nSection 8(e)(2) above, or (Y) a Renegotiation pursuant to\nSection 7(c) above.\n(ii)\nIn the event a player enters into a Designated Veteran\nPlayer Extension pursuant to Section 7(a)(3)(ii) above or a\nDesignated Veteran Player Contract pursuant to Article II,\nSection 7, the player may not be traded before one (1) year\nfollowing the date on which he entered into such\nDesignated Veteran Player Extension or Designated\nVeteran Player Contract.\n(g) In the event a Rookie Scale Contract is extended pursuant to\nSection 7(b) above and a Team proposes to trade such Contract to another\nTeam prior to the first day of the Salary Cap Year immediately following\nsuch Extension, then, only for purposes of determining whether the\nacquiring Team has Room for the Contract, the Salary for the last Salary\nCap Year of the original term of the Contract shall be deemed to equal the\naverage of the aggregate Salaries for such Salary Cap Year and each Salary\nCap Year of the extended term. For purposes of this subsection (g), the\nSalary for each Salary Cap Year of the extended term of the Contract shall\nbe the Salary as set forth in the Contract; provided, however, that:\nArticle VII\n265\n(i)\nIf the Contract provides for Base Compensation in the\nfirst Salary Cap Year of the extended term that is expressed\nas a percentage of the Salary Cap in accordance with\nArticle II, Section 7(d), then the Base Compensation in the\nextended term of the Contract shall be determined\nassuming that (a) the Salary Cap in the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term will equal one hundred four\nand one-half percent (104.5%) of the Salary Cap in effect\nat the time that the proposed trade would occur, and\n(b) the player does not meet any of the applicable Higher\nMax Criteria during the fourth Season of his Rookie Scale\nContract; or\n(ii)\nIf the Contract provides for Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses\nin the first Salary Cap Year of the extended term that\nexceeds the applicable Maximum Annual Salary that would\napply to such player assuming that the Salary Cap in the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term will\nequal one hundred four and one-half percent (104.5%) of\nthe Salary Cap in effect at the time that the proposed trade\nwould occur, then the Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the\nextended term of the Contract shall be determined to be\nthe Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses that would result from\nthe deemed amendment(s) pursuant to Article II,\nSection 7(c) using the assumption described above in this\nsubsection (ii).\n(h) If a Team trades a player and the assignee Team subsequently\nplaces the player on waivers, the assignor Team shall not be permitted to\nsign the player to a new Contract (or claim the player off of waivers) before\nthe earlier of: (i) one (1) year following the date all conditions to the trade\nwere satisfied; or (ii) the July 1 following the last Season of the player’s\nPlayer Contract.\n(i) Prior to the assignment of any Player Contract, the Team from\nwhich such Player Contract is to be assigned and the player whose Player\nContract is to be assigned shall be required to divest themselves, on terms\nmutually agreeable to the player and the Team, of any preexisting financial\narrangements between such Team and such player. The foregoing shall\n266\nArticle VII\nnot apply to Compensation earned by the player prior to the assignment\nor to loans.\n(j) As soon as is practicable following each trade (but in no event later\nthan one (1) week from the date of the trade), the NBA shall send to the\nPlayers Association, by email, a summary of the principal terms of the\ntrade; provided, however, that the NBA may omit from such summary any\nterms that the NBA or one (1) or more Teams involved in the trade\nreasonably deem confidential (other than such terms as may be necessary\nto verify the Teams’ compliance with Section 8(a) above).\n(k) A “trade” of a player under this Agreement shall mean an\nassignment of a Player Contract pursuant to a negotiated exchange\nbetween two or more Teams following a trade conference call with the\nNBA league office. For clarity, the word “trade” shall not include an\nassignment of a player via the NBA’s waiver procedures."

The audit reports provided for\nby this Section 10(a)(1) are to be prepared in accordance with the\nprovisions and definitions contained in this Agreement. The\nengagement of the Accountants shall be deemed to be renewed\nannually unless they are discharged by either party during the\nperiod from the submission of an Audit Report up to January 1 of\nthe following year. The parties agree to share equally the costs\nincurred by the Accountants in preparing the audit reports\nprovided for by this Section 10(a)(1).\n(2) The Accountants shall submit a “Draft Audit Report” for\neach Salary Cap Year to the NBA and the Players Association,\nalong with relevant supporting documentation, two (2) weeks prior\nto the scheduled issuance of the final Audit Report.\n(3) The final Audit Report shall be submitted by the Accountants\nto the parties by 6:00 p.m. eastern time on the last day of the Salary\nCap Year under audit. The audit shall begin as needed to ensure\nthere is no reduction in the audit duration compared to the 2011\nCBA. The Audit Report shall not be deemed final until the parties\nhave confirmed in writing their agreement (in a form acceptable to\nthe parties) with such Report. The NBA, the Players Association,\nand the Teams shall use their best efforts to facilitate the\nAccountants’ timely completion of the Audit Report.\n(4) In the event that, for any reason, the Accountants fail to\nsubmit to the parties a final Audit Report by 6:00 p.m. eastern time\non the last day of the Salary Cap Year under audit, the Accountants\nshall prepare an interim Audit Report (the “Interim Audit Report”)\nby such time setting forth the Accountants’ best estimate of BRI\nand Total Salaries and Benefits for the preceding Salary Cap Year\n268\nArticle VII\nand, based upon such best estimates, the Designated Share\nInformation. Such Interim Audit Report shall include:\n(i)\nAll amounts of BRI and Total Salaries and Benefits (or the\nportions thereof) and all Designated Share Information (or\nthe portions thereof) for such Salary Cap Year as to which\nthe Accountants have completed their review and, by\nwritten agreement of the Players Association and the NBA\n(waiving their respective rights to dispute such amounts),\nare not in dispute.\n(ii)\nWith respect to any amounts of BRI or Total Salaries and\nBenefits (or portions thereof) as to which the Accountants\nhave not completed their review or which are the subject\nof a good faith dispute between the parties, the NBA’s\ngood faith proposal as to the proper amount, if any, that\nshould be included in the Audit Report.\n(iii)\nWith respect to any items of Designated Share\nInformation that are the subject of a good faith dispute\nbetween the parties, the Accountants’ good faith\ndetermination as to such items, taking into account the\nprovisions of Sections 10(a)(4)(i) and (ii).\nAs soon as practicable after the Interim Audit Report is submitted to the\nparties, the Accountants shall submit the final Audit Report, including a\ndescription of the differences, if any, from the Interim Audit Report. The\nAudit Report shall not be deemed final until the parties have confirmed in\nwriting their agreement (in a form acceptable to the parties) with such\nReport or all disputes with respect to such Report have been finally\nresolved by means of the dispute-resolution procedures provided for by\nthis Agreement.\nIf, at the conclusion of the Audit Report Challenge Period (as defined by\nSection 12(a)(11) below), the Accountants have not submitted or are\nunable to submit a final Audit Report (because, by way of example but not\nlimitation, there are disputes or claims that have been asserted pursuant to\nArticle XXXII, Section 9(c) and which remain pending), the Accountants\nshall prepare and submit to the parties, within five (5) business days\nfollowing the completion of the Audit Report Challenge Period, an\nArticle VII\n269\nInterim Designated Share Audit Report that shall include the information\nset forth in the Interim Audit Report as adjusted or amended so as to\nreflect any final determinations made by the System Arbitrator or the\nAppeals Panel (as the case may be) in proceedings commenced pursuant\nto Article XXXII, Section 9(b) and involving disputes or claims with\nrespect to such Interim Audit Report. The sole purposes for which any\nInterim Designated Share Audit Report is to be used under this Agreement\nare to perform or form the basis for the calculations to be made pursuant\nto Section 12 below and, if applicable, to perform the calculations that\ndetermine whether the conditions to the parties’ mutual termination rights\nset forth in Article XXXIX, Sections 7-8 are satisfied.\n(b) For purposes of determining BRI, Total Salaries and Benefits, and\nthe Designated Share Information, the Accountants shall perform at least\nsuch review procedures as shall be agreed upon by the parties. In\nconnection with the preparation of Audit Reports for each Salary Cap\nYear, each Team and the NBA shall submit a report to the Accountants,\nthe NBA, and the Players Association setting forth BRI, Team Salaries,\nand Benefits information for such Salary Cap Year, on forms agreed upon\nby the NBA, the Players Association, and the Accountants (the “BRI\nReports”). The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon such\nforms no later than April 1 of each Salary Cap Year.\n(c) The Accountants shall review the reasonableness of any estimates\nof revenues or expenses for a Salary Cap Year included in the Teams’ and\nthe NBA’s BRI Reports for such Salary Cap Year and may make such\nadjustments in such estimates as they deem appropriate. To the extent the\nactual amounts of revenues received or expenses incurred for a Salary Cap\nYear differ from such estimates, adjustments shall be made in BRI for the\nfollowing Salary Cap Year in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 10(f) below.\n(d) With respect to deducted expenses, except for Newly-Deductible\nInternational Expenses, the NBA, League-related entities, Teams, and\nRelated Parties shall report in BRI Reports only those expenses that are\nreasonable and customary in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 1(a) above. Subject to the terms of Section 1(a)(6) and\nSection 1(a)(14) above, and Section 11 below, all categories of expenses\ndeducted in a BRI Report completed by the NBA or a Team shall be\nreviewed by the Accountants, but such categories shall be presumed to be\n270\nArticle VII\nreasonable and customary and the amount of the expenses deducted by\nthe NBA or a Team that come within such expense categories shall also\nbe presumed to be reasonable and customary, unless such categories or\namounts are found by the Accountants to be either unrelated to the\nrevenues involved or grossly excessive.\n(e) The Accountants shall notify designated representatives of the\nNBA and the Players Association: (1) if the Accountants have any\nquestions concerning the amounts of revenues or expenses reported by\nthe Teams and the NBA or any other information contained in the BRI\nReports; or (2) if the Accountants propose that any adjustments be made\nto any revenue or expense item or any other information contained in the\nBRI Reports.\n(f) The Accountants shall indicate which amounts included in BRI for\na Salary Cap Year, if any, represent estimates of revenues or expenses.\nWith respect to any such estimated revenues or expenses, the Accountants\nshall, in preparing the Audit Report for the immediately succeeding Salary\nCap Year (“Subsequent Audit Report”), or the Audit Report for the same\nSalary Cap Year in the event that an Interim Audit Report was previously\nissued for that Salary Cap Year, determine the actual revenues and\nexpenses received for the prior Salary Cap Year and include as a credit or\ndebit to BRI in such Subsequent Audit Report the amount of the aggregate\ndifference, if any, between all such estimated revenues and expenses for\nthe prior Salary Cap Year and the actual revenues and expenses received\nfor such Salary Cap Year.\n(g) In the event that in the course of preparing an Audit Report for a\nSalary Cap Year the Accountants discover that they committed an error in\ncomputing BRI in the Audit Reports for either of the two (2) previous\nSalary Cap Years, which error resulted in a material understatement or\noverstatement of BRI for either of such Salary Cap Years, and the parties\nagree that such error was committed and agree as to the amount of the\nresulting understatement or overstatement (or, if they do not agree, an\nerror (and the amount of such error) is established pursuant to the dispute\nresolution procedures provided for in this Agreement) the amount of such\nunderstatement or overstatement of BRI shall be added to or subtracted\nfrom BRI, as the case may be, with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1)\nyear Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of\nthe issuance of such Audit Report) accruing from the date of the Audit\nArticle VII\n271\nReport for the Salary Cap Year in which such understatement or\noverstatement occurred in equal annual amounts over the then-current\nand subsequent Salary Cap Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\nparties will jointly instruct the Accountants that their audits shall not\ninclude procedures specifically designed to detect errors committed in\nprior audits.\n(h) In the event that there is an NHL players’ strike or owners’ lockout\n(“work stoppage”) resulting in the cancellation of all or part of any NHL\nseason in any Salary Cap Year, and such work stoppage results in a refund\nbeing made to luxury suite-holders, premium seat license-holders, or to\npurchasers of fixed arena signage and/or naming rights in arenas in which\nboth an NBA Team and an NHL team plays its home games, then the\nrevenues for luxury suites, premium seat licenses, and fixed arena signage\nand/or naming rights in such arenas shall be determined as if such refunds\nwere not made. If the work stoppage continues for a second year, then\nthe NHL revenues shall be deemed to be the amount included for the\nprior year.\n(i) All disputes with respect to any Interim Audit Report shall be\nresolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in\nArticle XXXII.\n(j) In the event of a trade that (i) occurs after the final Audit Report for\na Salary Cap Year is submitted by the Accountants and before the\nconclusion of such Salary Cap Year, and (ii) results in a player earning a trade\nbonus, the final Audit Report shall be amended to reflect such trade bonus\nfor purposes of calculating such player’s Salary and the Team’s Team Salary\n(and thus, for clarity, for the purposes of computing the amount of tax the\nTeam owes pursuant to Article VII, Section 2(d)); however, the portion of\nsuch trade bonus that is included in the Team’s Team Salary for such Salary\nCap Year shall be excluded from Total Salaries for such Salary Cap Year,\nand included in Total Salaries for the immediately following Salary Cap Year."

In the event that, in the opinion of the Players Association’s\nAccountants, such audit indicates misallocations or miscategorizations of\nrevenues or expenses (other than with respect to matters that constituted\nDisputed Adjustments in connection with the prior Audit Report) resulting\nin an understatement of BRI, they shall submit to the NBA proposed\nadjustments to BRI consistent with their findings. In the event that the\nNBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments shall\nbe deemed to be “Disputed Adjustments” and shall be resolved in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII. In addition, in\nthe event that First Audit Disputed Adjustments in excess of $8 million are\nresolved in favor of the Players Association, the Players Association shall\nthen have the right, that Season, to have the Players Association’s\nAccountants audit up to an additional ten (10) NBA teams for the same\nSalary Cap Year, in accordance with the foregoing procedures (the “Second\nAudit”). If, as a result of the Second Audit, additional Disputed\nAdjustments in excess of $8 million are resolved in favor of the Players\nAssociation, the Players Association shall then have the right, that Season,\nto have the Players Association’s Accountants audit all remaining NBA\nTeams for that Salary Cap Year. The amount of any and all Disputed\nAdjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the Players Association\nin accordance with this Section 11(a) shall be added to BRI in the Salary Cap\nYear in which such resolution is reached. The aggregate number of NBA\nTeams selected for the First Audit by the Players Association over the course\nof the first six (6) Salary Cap Years of the CBA will be ninety (90), to be\ndistributed over the Salary Cap Years at the Players Association’s option.\nFor the seventh Salary Cap Year of the CBA, the Players Association will be\nentitled to select fifteen (15) NBA Teams for First Audits, supplemented by\nany of the ninety (90) audits that were not used in a previous Salary Cap\nYear.\n(b) League Audit. The Players Association shall have the right as part\nof the annual review of BRI Reports to retain the Players Association’s\nAccountants to conduct an audit, at its own expense, of the books and\nrecords of the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, and other League-related\nentities associated with generating BRI, provided, however, that such audit\nArticle VII\n273\nshall be limited to (i) revenue items (including in respect of equity\ntransactions subject to Section 1(a)(13) above) and (ii) expense items,\nregardless of whether such expenses exceed the applicable BRI ratio of\nexpenses to revenues set forth in Exhibit D, in each case that appear or\nshould have appeared in the BRI Report. In the event that, in the opinion\nof the Players Association’s Accountants, such audit indicates misallocations\nor miscategorizations of revenues or expenses (other than with respect to\nmatters that constituted League Disputed Adjustments in connection with\nthe prior Audit Report) resulting in an understatement of BRI, they shall\nsubmit proposed adjustments to the NBA consistent with their findings. In\nthe event that the NBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed\nadjustments shall be deemed to be League Disputed Adjustments and\nresolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII. The\namount of any and all such League Disputed Adjustments that are resolved\nin the Players Association’s favor shall be included in BRI in the Salary Cap\nYear in which such resolution is reached. In addition, in the event that any\nsuch League Disputed Adjustments are resolved in the Players Association’s\nfavor, the Accountants shall be directed to correct such expense\nmisallocations and/or miscategorizations in the remaining Salary Cap Years\ncovered by the Agreement.\n(c) Confidentiality. In connection with any audit conducted by the\nPlayers Association pursuant to this Section 11, the Players Association\nagrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a confidentiality\nagreement in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit J-1. The Players\nAssociation also agrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a\nsimilar confidentiality agreement with respect to information obtained in\nconnection with the Accountants’ audit pursuant to Section 10 above.\n(d) Preceding\nSalary\nCap\nYear\nAudit\nAdjustments.\nNotwithstanding anything else in this Agreement or any release in the annual\nBRI letter agreement, if upward or downward adjustments are made in\nconnection with a Players Association-initiated audit, an adjustment to BRI\nin respect of the same item can also be made for revenues or expenses\nrelated to the preceding Salary Cap Year, if applicable. For example, without\nlimitation, if, based on the audit findings, the parties agree that a Team\nunder-reported 2023-24 BRI by one million dollars ($1,000,000), and that\nthe same error in the same amount occurred in 2022-23, then 2024-25 BRI\nwould be adjusted upward by two million dollars ($2,000,000).\n274\nArticle VII\n(e) Related Party Access. The Players Association’s Accountants\nshall have access to such portions of a Related Party’s books and records\nthat the accountants have a well-founded basis to believe have a meaningful\nimpact on BRI. For purposes of the foregoing, (i) where a team plays in an\narena owned or operated by a Related Party, the Players Association’s\nAccountants will have access to that Related Party arena company’s trial\nbalance relating to all revenues and to such other portions of the trial balance\nthat the Players Association’s Accountants have a well-founded basis to\nbelieve have a meaningful impact on BRI; (ii) for other Related Parties,\ninformation requests should fit the circumstances to enable the Players\nAssociation’s Accountants to verify the accuracy of BRI amounts (x) that\ncannot reasonably be verified through other means, and (y) without\naccessing financial and business information that there is no well-founded\nbasis to believe have a meaningful impact on BRI; and (iii) the NBA, Players\nAssociation, and the Team will collectively consider any request for access\nto Related Party books and records while onsite and make their best efforts\nto resolve the access issue.\n(f) Bilateral Adjustments. Subject to the deadlines set forth in\nSection 11(g) below, the NBA may propose BRI adjustments with respect\nto any Team audited by the Players Association. The NBA’s right to\npropose such adjustments may not adversely affect in any way the time and\nresources available to the Players Association under its audit rights. In the\nevent that the Players Association disputes such proposed adjustments, such\nproposed adjustments shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in Article XXXII. The amount of any and all such proposed\nadjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the NBA in accordance\nwith this Section 11(f), including any adjustments made pursuant to\nSection 11(d) above, shall be deducted from BRI in the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich such resolution is reached.\n(g) Timing. Audits conducted by the Players Association must be\nnoticed within ninety (90) days after issuance of the final Audit Report in\nrespect of the applicable Salary Cap Year. Any proposed adjustments by the\nPlayers Association and NBA relating to Team audits (and in the case of the\nPlayers Association, with respect to any League Office audits) will be\nresolved by April 30 of the following calendar year. Each party will provide\nits proposed adjustments by March 25.\nArticle VII\n275"

and\nArticle VII\n(ii)\n279\nWith respect to each Salary Cap Year beginning with the\n2024-25 Salary Cap Year, one hundred four and one-half\npercent (104.5%) of Forecasted BRI for the immediately\npreceding Salary Cap Year.\n(18) “Governing Audit Report” means, with respect to a Salary Cap\nYear, the Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year, or, if no final Audit\nReport has been submitted at the conclusion of the Audit Report\nChallenge Period, the Interim Designated Share Audit Report for\nsuch Salary Cap Year.\n(19) “Interest Amount” means, with respect to a Salary Cap Year,\nthe Carryover Interest Rate for such Salary Cap Year multiplied by\nthe Carryover Amount with respect to such Salary Cap Year.\n(20) “Overage” or “Overage Amount” means, with respect to a\nSalary Cap Year, the amount, if any, by which Adjusted Total Salaries\nand Benefits for such Salary Cap Year exceeds the Designated Share\nfor such Salary Cap Year.\n(21) “Shortfall Amount” means, with respect to a Salary Cap Year,\nthe amount, if any, by which the Designated Share for such Salary\nCap Year exceeds Adjusted Total Salaries and Benefits for such\nSalary Cap Year.\n(22) “Team Overage Balance” means for a Team, with respect to a\nSalary Cap Year, the Overage Amount (if any) for such Salary Cap\nYear to which such Team is entitled (calculated in accordance with\nSection 12(d) below), adjusted in accordance with Section 12(e)\nbelow.\n(23) “Uncapped Reduction Amount” means, with respect to a Salary\nCap Year, the sum of the Overage Amount, the Carryover Amount,\nand the Interest Amount with respect to such Salary Cap Year.\n(24) “Withholding Percentage” means, with respect to a Salary Cap\nYear, ten percent (10%), provided that in the event that the Salary\nCap for such Salary Cap Year is limited to one hundred ten percent\n(110%) of the Salary Cap for the immediately preceding Salary Cap\nYear pursuant to Section 2(a)(5) above, then the NBA and Players\nAssociation shall discuss in good faith reducing the Withholding\n280\nArticle VII\nPercentage (i.e., to a percentage that is less than ten percent (10%)),\ntaking into account reasonable estimates of Team and League\nfinancial performance (accounting for attendant risks and the likely\nsize of any Shortfall Amount).\n(b) Benefit Adjustment.\n(1) In the event that, for a Salary Cap Year, prior to any reduction\npursuant to this Section 12(b)(1), the Uncapped Reduction Amount\nless any Shortfall Amount would exceed ten percent (10%) of\nAdjusted Total Salaries, the Additional Benefit Amount as provided\nfor by Article IV, Section 4(d)(1) (i.e., the one percent (1%) of BRI\namount for additional benefits) shall be reduced by such excess\namount (or, if such excess amount is greater than the Additional\nBenefit Amount, then the Additional Benefit Amount shall be\nreduced in full). Any reduction to the Additional Benefit Amount\nfor a Salary Cap Year pursuant to this Section 12(b)(1) shall be\ndeducted from Total Benefits (and, thus, Adjusted Total Benefits)\nfor such Salary Cap Year (thus decreasing the Overage Amount\nand/or increasing the Shortfall Amount for such Salary Cap Year,\nas applicable).\n(2) For purposes of calculating Projected Benefits (and, thus, the\nSalary Cap) for a Salary Cap Year, no reduction expected to be made\npursuant to Section 12(b)(1) above shall be taken into account.\n(c) Compensation Adjustments.\n(1) For each Salary Cap Year, each Compensation payment made\nto a player in respect of the Season encompassed by such Salary Cap\nYear pursuant to an Adjustment Contract shall be adjusted by the\npercentage reduction that, when applied to each remaining\nCompensation payment in respect of that Season pursuant to such\nAdjustment Contract, and taking into account any Compensation\nadjustments already made pursuant to this Section 12(c), would\nresult in a reduction (pursuant to this Section 12(c)) of the total\nCompensation payable to such player pursuant to the Adjustment\nContract in respect of that Season equal to the then-applicable\nContract Reduction Amount.\nArticle VII\n281\n(2) In the event that, as of the completion of the Governing Audit\nReport, the Compensation payable to a player pursuant to the\nAdjustment Contract has already been reduced pursuant to this\nSection 12(c) by an amount that exceeds the then-applicable\nContract Reduction Amount, then such excess shall be paid to the\nplayer in equal installments over the remaining semi-monthly\npayment dates on which payments are due to such player for the\napplicable Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract beginning\nwith either the next semi-monthly payment date following the\nissuance of the Governing Audit Report or, if practicability warrants,\nthe second semi-monthly payment date following the issuance of the\nGoverning Audit Report (or, if there are no remaining payments due\nto such player for the applicable Season pursuant to the Adjustment\nContract, such excess shall be paid to the player within sixty (60)\ndays following the completion of the Governing Audit Report).\n(3) If for any reason, in respect of a Salary Cap Year, the Contract\nReduction Amount for an Adjustment Contract exceeds the amount\nby which the Compensation provided for by such Contract was\ndecreased pursuant to this Section 12(c) above, then the Players\nAssociation shall make good faith efforts to facilitate the applicable\nTeam’s recovery of such excess from the applicable player via a\ndirect payment. In the event any amount remains outstanding as of\nthe first semi-monthly payment date for the immediately following\nSalary Cap Year, such outstanding amount shall be subtracted from\nthe Contract Reduction Amount for such Adjustment Contract in\nrespect of the Salary Cap Year with respect to which such amount\nremains outstanding (and the parties shall adjust (or, if necessary,\ndeem amended) the Governing Audit Report to reflect such\ndecrease).\n(4) Within seven (7) days after receiving any set of Adjustment\nSchedules from the NBA, or within seven (7) days after any event\nthat the Players Association believes warrants a change in any\npreviously-issued Adjustment Schedules, the Players Association\nmay bring a proceeding before the System Arbitrator, in accordance\nwith Article XXXII, Section 10, contesting the NBA’s calculation of\nany player’s Compensation adjustment pursuant to this\nSection 12(c). Notwithstanding the commencement of any such\nproceeding, each Team shall continue making Compensation\n282\nArticle VII\nadjustments in accordance with this Section 12(c), and in no event\nshall any Team be prohibited from making such Compensation\nadjustments prior to a final determination in any such proceeding.\nIn the event that the NBA makes a determination, or a final\ndetermination is made in a proceeding in accordance with this\nSection 12(c)(4), that an adjustment to a player’s Compensation was\nerroneously calculated by the NBA, the sole remedy with respect to\nany amounts erroneously deducted from the player’s Compensation\nshall be to modify, as soon as practicable, the deduction amounts\napplicable to such player so as to reduce, in equal amounts, all\nscheduled future deductions from post-determination payments of\nCompensation until the amount of any prior over-deduction is fully\noffset; provided, however, that to the extent that reducing the\nplayer’s future deductions would not fully offset the prior\nover-deductions, the NBA shall instruct the applicable Team to pay\nthe player as soon as practicable such additional amounts as are\nnecessary to fully offset such over-deductions.\n(d) Team Overage Balance. In respect of each Salary Cap Year, each\nTeam’s Team Overage Balance shall (prior to any adjustments made in\naccordance with Section 12(e) below) equal:\n(1) If there is an Overage Amount that is less than or equal to ten\npercent (10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries: the Overage Amount\ndivided by thirty (30).\n(2) If there is an Overage Amount that is greater than ten percent\n(10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries: an amount equal to the sum of\n(i) ten percent (10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries divided by\nthirty (30), and (ii) the amount by which the Overage exceeds ten\npercent (10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries, multiplied by a fraction,\nthe numerator of which is the Team’s Adjusted Team Salary for such\nSalary Cap Year, and the denominator of which is Adjusted Total\nSalaries for such Salary Cap Year.\n(3) If the Overage Amount is zero (0): zero (0).\n(e) Allocation of Distribution Amount. Each Salary Cap Year, as part\nof the Governing Audit Report, the following processes will apply with\nArticle VII\n283\nrespect to Team Overage Balances and the Distribution Amount for such\nSalary Cap Year (the “Distribution Year”):\n(1) Beginning with the earliest Salary Cap Year in respect of which\nthe Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than zero (0):\n(i)\nIf the Distribution Year is later than such Salary Cap Year,\nthen each Team’s Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year shall be increased by an amount equal to its\nTeam Overage Balance in respect of such Salary Cap Year\nmultiplied by the Carryover Interest Rate in respect of the\nDistribution Year (and thus the Aggregate Team Overage\nBalance in respect of such Salary Cap Year shall be increased\nby the sum of the increase to each Team’s Team Overage\nBalance in accordance with this Section 12(e)(1)(i)); and\n(ii)\nWith respect to such Salary Cap Year, the Distribution\nAmount for the Distribution Year shall be allocated as\nfollows:\n(A)\nIf the Distribution Amount is greater than or equal\nto the Aggregate Team Overage Balance in respect\nof such Salary Cap Year, each Team shall be\nallocated a portion of the Distribution Amount\nequal to its Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year. As a result, each Team’s Team\nOverage Balance in respect of such Salary Cap Year\n(and thus the Aggregate Team Overage Balance in\nrespect of such Salary Cap Year) shall be reduced to\nzero (0); or\n(B)\nIf the Distribution Amount is less than the\nAggregate Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year, each Team shall be allocated a\nportion of the Distribution Amount in proportion\nto its Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year. As a result, each Team’s Team\nOverage Balance in respect of such Salary Cap Year\nshall be reduced by its respective allocated amount\n(and thus the Aggregate Team Overage Balance in\n284\nArticle VII\nrespect of such Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by\nthe sum of such allocated amounts).\n(2) The process described in Section 12(e)(1) above shall then be\nrepeated, in chronological order, for each successive Salary Cap Year\nfor which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than\nzero (0), utilizing the portion of the Distribution Amount for the\nDistribution Year that has not yet been allocated to Teams in respect\nof an earlier Salary Cap Year.\n(3) If, as a result of the existence of a Shortfall Amount for the\nDistribution Year and following the procedures described in\nSections 12(e)(1)-(2) above, the portion of the Distribution Amount\nthat has not been allocated to Teams is greater than zero (0), such\nunallocated portion of the Distribution Amount shall then be\nallocated to each player in proportion to the Adjustment Salary\nprovided for by his Adjustment Contract(s) (as a percentage of\nAdjusted Total Salaries) for the Distribution Year. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, if the portion of the Distribution Amount to be\nallocated to players pursuant to this Section 12(e)(3) in respect of the\nDistribution Year exceeds the Aggregate Reduction Amount in\nrespect of such Salary Cap Year, then such excess, rather than being\nallocated to each player in proportion to the Adjustment Salary\nprovided for by his Adjustment Contract(s), shall be allocated to\neach player on such proportional basis as may be reasonably\ndetermined by the Players Association.\nExample: Assume (i) as set forth in the Governing Audit Report for the 2024-25\nSalary Cap Year (i.e., the Distribution Year), the 2024-25 Distribution Amount is\n$500 million, and (ii) prior to any allocations of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount\npursuant to this Section 12(e), there is a 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance\nof $200 million and a 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $400 million,\nand (iii) the 2024-25 Carryover Interest Rate is five percent (5%).\nThe earliest Salary Cap Year in which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater\nthan zero (0) is the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year. Because the 2024-25 Distribution\nYear is later than the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, each Team’s 2023-24 Team\nOverage Balance (and hence the 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance) would\nbe increased by five percent (5%) (i.e., the 2024-25 Carryover Interest Rate). As a\nArticle VII\n285\nresult of such increase, the 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be $210\nmillion (i.e., $200 million increased by five percent (5%)).\nThe 2024-25 Distribution Amount of $500 million is greater than the 2023-24\nAggregate Team Overage Balance of $210 million. Accordingly, $210 million of the\n2024-25 Distribution Amount would be allocated to Teams in amounts equal to each\nTeam’s 2023-24 Team Overage Balance. As a result of such allocation, each Team’s\n2023-24 Team Overage Balance (and hence the 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage\nBalance) would be zero (0).\nThe next Salary Cap Year in which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater\nthan zero (0) is the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year. The Distribution Year is not later\nthan the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year and thus neither each Team’s 2024-25 Team\nOverage Balance nor the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be\nincreased pursuant to Section 12(e)(1)(i) above.\nThe unallocated portion of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount is $290 million ($500\nmillion less the $210 million amount that was allocated in respect of the 2023-24\nSalary Cap Year), which is less than the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance\nof $400 million. Accordingly, $290 million of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount\nwould be allocated to Teams in proportion to each Team’s 2024-25 Team Overage\nBalance. As a result of such allocation, each Team’s 2024-25 Team Overage Balance\nwould be decreased by its respective allocation of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount\n(and hence the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be reduced by $290\nmillion), resulting in a 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $110 million\n($400 million less the $290 million amount allocated from the 2024-25 Distribution\nAmount).\nIn accordance with Section 12(e)(3) above, no portion of the 2024-25 Distribution\nAmount would be allocated to players in respect of 2024-25 Adjustment Contracts.\n(f) Team Reconciliation Payments. The NBA shall facilitate the\nfollowing payments to be made within sixty (60) days following the\ncompletion of the Governing Audit Report in respect of each Salary Cap\nYear, based on the allocations described in Section 12(e) above. Each Team\nshall be entitled to receive or, if the result of the following calculation is\n286\nArticle VII\nnegative for such Team, required to pay, the following amount in respect of\na Salary Cap Year:\n(1) The sum of: (i) the total Distribution Amount allocated to the\nTeam in accordance with Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above; and (ii) the\nportion of the Distribution Amount allocated in accordance with\nSection 12(e)(3) above to each player in respect of an Adjustment\nContract for which the Team is (or was) the last Team responsible\nfor making payments to the player in respect of the Season\nencompassed by the Salary Cap Year for which the Governing Audit\nReport was just completed; less\n(2) The sum of: (i) the total amount by which such Team reduced\n(or is scheduled to reduce) Compensation payments to players in\nrespect of the Season encompassed by such Salary Cap Year\npursuant to Section 12(c) above; and (ii) the Shortfall Amount (if\nany) in respect of such Salary Cap Year divided by the number of\nTeams that played in the NBA during such Salary Cap Year.\n(g) Player Reconciliation Payments. Following completion of the\nGoverning Audit Report in respect of each Salary Cap Year, each player to\nwhom a portion of the Distribution Amount is allocated in accordance with\nSection 12(e)(3) above shall be paid the amount of such allocation in respect\nof an Adjustment Contract by the final Team responsible for making\npayments to such player pursuant to such Adjustment Contract in respect\nof the Salary Cap Year for which the Governing Audit Report was just\ncompleted. Such payment shall be made to the player in equal installments\nover the remaining semi-monthly dates on which payments are due to the\nplayer for the applicable Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract\nbeginning with either the next semi-monthly payment date following the\nissuance of the Governing Audit Report or, if practicability warrants, the\nsecond semi-monthly payment date following the issuance of the Governing\nAudit Report (or, if there are no remaining payments due to the player for\nsuch Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract, in one (1) payment to be\nmade within sixty (60) days following the completion of the Governing\nAudit Report).\n(h) Survival of Obligation and Terms. In the event that, upon the\nexpiration or termination of this Agreement, there is an Aggregate Team\nOverage Balance in respect of any Salary Cap Year (including the final Salary\nArticle VII\n287\nCap Year of this Agreement) that is greater than zero (0), the sum total of\nany Aggregate Team Overage Balances shall be due and owing by the players\nto the Teams and shall be recouped in full by the Teams under a successor\ncollective bargaining agreement via reductions to the Compensation\notherwise payable to players (i) no later than the Salary Cap Years in which\nsuch Aggregate Team Overage Balances would have been recouped\npursuant to this Section 12 had these provisions continued in effect, and\n(ii) using the method described in this Section 12 or such other method as\nis mutually agreed by the parties. Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Agreement, the terms of this Section 12(h) shall survive the expiration\nor termination of this Agreement. For clarity, nothing in this Section 12(h)\nshall impact any right to engage in any strikes, lockouts, or cessations or\nother stoppages of work following the expiration or termination of this\nAgreement.\n(i) Information to Be Included in Audit Report. The parties shall\ncause the Accountants to include in the Interim Audit Report and the\nGoverning Audit Report for each Salary Cap Year schedules setting forth,\nwith respect to such Salary Cap Year:\n(1) BRI, the Designated Share, Total Salaries and Benefits, and\nAdjusted Total Salaries and Benefits;\n(2) the Overage Amount or the Shortfall Amount (as applicable);\n(3) the Actual Reduction Percentage;\n(4) the Aggregate Reduction Amount;\n(5) the Distribution Amount;\n(6) the Aggregate Team Overage Balance and each Team’s Team\nOverage Balance, both before and after the application of\nSections 12(e)(1)-(2) above;\n(7) for each prior Salary Cap Year in respect of which the\nAggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than zero (0) prior to\nthe application of Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above, the Aggregate Team\nOverage Balance and each Team’s Team Overage Balance in respect\nof each such prior Salary Cap Year, both before and after the\napplication of Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above;\n288\nArticle VII\n(8) a listing of each Team and the Distribution Amount allocated\nto each such Team in accordance with Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above;\n(9) a listing of each Adjustment Contract, the associated Contract\nReduction Amount, and the Distribution Amount allocated to the\nplayer in respect of such Adjustment Contract in accordance with\nSection 12(e)(3) above;\n(10) a summary of the reconciliation payments described in\nSections 12(f)-(g) above;\n(11) the amount (if any) by which each Team’s Tax Team Salary (as\ncomputed pursuant to Section 2(d) above) exceeds the Tax Level,\nand the resulting tax payment due by the Team;\n(12) the amount (if any) of any Minimum Team Salary payment\nowed by a team in accordance with Section 2(c) above; and\n(13) the amount (if any) by which each Team’s Apron Team Salary\n(as computed pursuant to Section 2(e) above) exceeds the Second\nApron Level.\n(j)\nMiscellaneous.\n(1) For all purposes under this Agreement, the computation of a\nplayer’s Salary or Adjustment Salary shall be made without regard to\nany adjustment made (or to be made) to such player’s Compensation\nin accordance with this Section 12.\n(2) When (i) pursuant to Article VI, Section 1 or Article XLI,\nSection 4(e), a player has forfeited a portion of his Compensation\nfor a Season (payable to him pursuant to an Adjustment Contract)\n(the “forfeited amount”) and (ii) following the completion of the\nGoverning Audit Report, the Contract Reduction Amount for such\nAdjustment Contract for the applicable Salary Cap Year is greater\nthan zero (0), then the player shall be entitled to a refund of a portion\nof the forfeited amount. The refund shall be in an amount equal to\nthe Contract Reduction Amount for the Adjustment Contract for\nthe Salary Cap Year to which the forfeited amount related multiplied\nby a fraction, the numerator of which is the forfeited amount, and\nthe denominator of which is the player’s Base Compensation for\nArticle VII\n289\nsuch Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract as of the date(s)\nthe Compensation was forfeited. For clarity, the amount of the\nrefund shall be less all amounts required to be withheld by any\ngovernmental authority. For purposes of the foregoing calculation,\na player’s Contract Reduction Amount shall be deemed to include\nonly the portion of the player’s Contract Reduction Amount that\nrelates to the Base Compensation for the applicable Season set forth\nin the applicable Adjustment Contract. Such refund shall be made\nto the player within sixty (60) days following the completion of the\nGoverning Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year in which the\nforfeited amount is collected.\n290"

Such Options shall be exercisable by notice to the player that is either\npersonally delivered to the player or his representative or sent by email or\npre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of\nthe player or his representative, signed by the Team, informing the player\nthat the Team has exercised such Option.\n(b) (i)\nThe Rookie Salary Scale applicable to a First Round Pick is\ndetermined by the first Season to be covered by the player’s\nRookie Scale Contract. Accordingly, for example, if a\nplayer’s Rookie Scale Contract commences with the 2023-24\nSeason, the 2023-24 Rookie Salary Scale shall apply. Within\na particular Rookie Salary Scale, a First Round Pick’s\napplicable Rookie Scale Amounts are determined by the\nplayer’s selection number in the NBA Draft. Accordingly,\nfor example, the Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to the\neighth player selected in the first round of the NBA Draft\nshall be those specified in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale\nfor the eighth pick. Notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in this Section 1(b)(i) or in Section 1(b)(ii) below,\nbeginning on January 10 of each Season, an unsigned First\nRound Pick’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount for such\nSeason shall be reduced daily through the end of the Regular\nArticle VIII\n291\nSeason by an amount equal to the applicable Rookie Scale\nAmount (as set forth in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale)\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1)\nand the denominator of which is the total number of days in\nsuch Regular Season.\n(ii)\nNotwithstanding Section 1(b)(i) above, if, pursuant to any\nprovision of this Agreement or the NBA Constitution and\nBy-Laws, one (1) or more Teams is required to forfeit\none (1) or more draft picks in the first round of a particular\nNBA Draft, then:\n(A)\nthe Rookie Salary Scale for the Salary Cap Year\nimmediately following such Draft (or the Salary Cap\nYear of such Draft if the Draft occurs on or after\nJuly 1) shall be adjusted by removing one (1) or more\nRookie Scale Amounts from the middle of the\nRookie Salary Scale, as follows: if one (1) first round\npick is forfeited, then the Rookie Scale Amounts that\nwould have been applicable to the 15th player\nselected in the first round (absent any forfeiture of\npicks) (hereinafter, the “15th Pick”) shall be\nremoved from the Rookie Salary Scale; if two (2) first\nround picks are forfeited, then the Rookie Scale\nAmounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the pick\nimmediately following the 15th Pick shall be\nremoved from the Rookie Salary Scale; if three (3)\nfirst round picks are forfeited, then the Rookie Scale\nAmounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the picks\nimmediately preceding and immediately following\nthe 15th Pick shall be removed from the Rookie\nSalary Scale; and if more than three picks are\nforfeited, additional Rookie Scale Amounts shall be\nremoved from the Rookie Salary Scale in accordance\nwith the foregoing procedure; and\n(B)\nthe Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to players\nselected in such Draft shall be determined by their\nselection number under the Rookie Salary Scale as\nadjusted by Section 1(b)(ii)(A) above. Accordingly,\n292\nArticle VIII\nfor example, if one First Round Pick were forfeited\nin the first round of the 2024 Draft, the applicable\nRookie Scale Amounts would remain unchanged for\nthe first 14 picks, and the Rookie Scale Amounts\napplicable to the remaining 15 picks in the first\nround would be the Rookie Scale Amounts that\n(absent any forfeiture of picks) would have been\napplicable to picks 16 through 30.\n(c) (i)\nA Rookie Scale Contract shall provide in each of the two (2)\nSeasons covered by the Contract and the first Option Year\nfor Current Base Compensation of at least the greater of:\n(A) eighty percent (80%) of the applicable Rookie Scale\nAmount, and (B) the player’s applicable Minimum Player\nSalary. Components of Salary in excess of the foregoing\namount, if any, are subject to individual negotiation, except\nthat (1) in no event may Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for any\nSalary Cap Year exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%)\nof the applicable Rookie Scale Amount, and (2) a Rookie\nScale Contract may not provide for a signing bonus (except\nfor an “international player” payment in excess of the\nExcluded International Player Payment Amount made in\naccordance with Article VII, Section 3(e)) or a loan. A\nRookie Scale Contract may provide for a payment schedule\nin any Season that is more favorable to the player than that\ncalled for under Paragraph 3 of the Uniform Player\nContract, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.\n(ii)\nA Rookie Scale Contract must provide for Compensation\nprotection for lack of skill and injury or illness in each of the\ntwo (2) Seasons covered by the Contract and the first Option\nYear of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the applicable\nRookie Scale Amount. To the extent permitted by Article\nII, Section 4(l), a Team and a First Round Pick may negotiate\nadditional conditions or limitations applicable to the player’s\nBase Compensation protection, except that lack of skill and\ninjury or illness protection of at least eighty percent (80%)\nof the applicable Rookie Scale Amount in each of the first\ntwo (2) Seasons and the first Option Year shall contain no\nArticle VIII\n293\nsuch individually-negotiated additional conditions or\nlimitations.\n(iii)\nThe terms and conditions (other than with respect to the\npayment schedule for the player’s Base Compensation) that\napply to the second Option Year shall be unchanged from\nall terms and conditions that applied to the first Option Year\n(including, but not limited to, the percentage of Base\nCompensation that is protected), except that the Salary\n(excluding Incentive Compensation) and, if the Rookie Scale\nContract provides for Incentive Compensation for the first\nOption Year, then the amount of each bonus, for the second\nOption Year shall be increased over the Salary (excluding\nIncentive Compensation) and amount of each bonus,\nrespectively, for the first Option Year by the applicable\npercentage specified in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale.\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a trade\nof a Rookie Scale Contract would, by reason of a trade bonus contained in\nsuch Contract, cause the player’s Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the Salary\nCap Year in which such trade occurs to exceed one hundred twenty\npercent (120%) of the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount for such\nSalary Cap Year, such player’s trade bonus shall be deemed amended to the\nextent necessary to reduce the player’s Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for such\nSalary Cap Year to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the applicable\nRookie Scale Amount."

If such a Qualifying\nOffer is not made, then the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent\non such July 1.\n320\n(c)\nArticle XI\n(i)\nA player who receives a Qualifying Offer must be given until\nthe October 1 following its issuance to accept it.\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Qualifying Offer\nmay be withdrawn by the Team at any time through the\nJuly 13 following its issuance. If the Qualifying Offer is not\nwithdrawn on or before July 13, it may be withdrawn\nthereafter but only if the player agrees in writing to the\nwithdrawal. If a Qualifying Offer is withdrawn, the player\nshall immediately become an Unrestricted Free Agent. If a\nQualifying Offer is withdrawn on or after July 14, the Team\nalso shall be deemed to have renounced the player in\naccordance with Article VII, Section 4(g). A player may not\naccept a Qualifying Offer after the October 1 following the\nissuance thereof, unless the Team, prior to October 1,\nextends the date by which the player may accept the\nQualifying Offer. In order to extend the date by which a\nplayer may accept his Qualifying Offer, a Team shall provide\nthe player with written notice of the extension, which shall\nbe either personally delivered to the player or his\nrepresentative or sent by email or pre-paid certified,\nregistered, or overnight mail to the last known address of the\nplayer or his representative. For clarity, there shall be no\nlimit on the number of times a Team may extend the date by\nwhich a player may accept a Qualifying Offer. In no event\nmay the acceptance date for a Qualifying Offer be extended\nbeyond, or may a player accept a Qualifying Offer beyond,\nthe March 1 following its issuance.\n(ii)\nIf a Qualifying Offer is neither withdrawn nor accepted and\nthe deadline for accepting it passes, the Team’s Right of First\nRefusal shall continue, subject to Section 5(a) below.\n(iii)\nA player who knows that he has a medical disability that\nwould render him unable to perform the playing services\nrequired under a Player Contract the following Season may\nnot validly accept a Qualifying Offer received under this\nSection 4 or Section 5 below, unless the ROFR Team\nconsents after disclosure of such medical disability.\nNotwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, a\nplayer who knows that he has a medical disability that would\nArticle XI\n321\nrender him unable to perform the playing services required\nunder a Player Contract the following Season remains\nsubject to the ROFR Team’s Right of First Refusal.\n(d) Any claim that a Contract offered as a Qualifying Offer or a\nMaximum Qualifying Offer fails to meet one or more of the criteria for a\nQualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying Offer shall be made by notice\nto the Team, in writing, no later than ten (10) days after a copy of the\nQualifying Offer or Maximum Qualifying Offer was given by the Team or\nthe NBA to the Players Association. Such notice must set forth the specific\nchanges that allegedly must be made to the offered Contract in order for it\nto constitute a Qualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying Offer. Upon\nreceipt of such notice, if the requested changes are necessary to satisfy the\nrequirements of a Qualifying Offer or a Maximum Qualifying Offer, the\nTeam may, within five (5) business days, offer the player an amended\nContract incorporating the requested changes. If the Team offers such an\namended Contract, the player and the Players Association shall be precluded\nfrom asserting that such Contract does not constitute a timely and valid\nQualifying Offer or Maximum Qualifying Offer."

        "content": "Restricted Free Agency.\n(a) If a Restricted Free Agent does not sign an Offer Sheet with any\nTeam by March 1 of the Season for which the Qualifying Offer is made, and\ndoes not sign a Player Contract with the ROFR Team before that Season\nends, then his ROFR Team may reassert its Right of First Refusal for the\nfollowing Season by extending another Qualifying Offer (with the same\nterms, including the amount of Salary (excluding Incentive Compensation),\nLikely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, that were included in\nthe prior Qualifying Offer) by 5:00 p.m. eastern time on the next June 29.\nA ROFR Team may continue to reassert its Right of First Refusal by\nfollowing the foregoing procedure in each subsequent year in which that\nRestricted Free Agent does not sign an Offer Sheet with any Team by\nMarch 1 of the Season for which the Qualifying Offer is made, and does not\nsign a Player Contract with the ROFR Team before that Season ends. In\neach Season in which a Team reasserts its Right of First Refusal by extending\nanother Qualifying Offer in accordance with this Section 5(a), the Team may\nalso elect to simultaneously provide the player with a Maximum Qualifying\nOffer (with the same terms that were included in the prior Maximum\n322\nArticle XI\nQualifying Offer). Any such Qualifying Offer and Maximum Qualifying\nOffer shall be governed by the provisions of Section 4 above.\n(b) When a Restricted Free Agent receives an offer to sign a Player\nContract from a Team other than the ROFR Team (the “New Team”),\nwhich he desires to accept, he shall give to the ROFR Team a completed\ncertificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G annexed hereto (the “Offer\nSheet”), signed by the Restricted Free Agent and the New Team, which shall\nhave attached to it a Uniform Player Contract separately specifying: (i) the\n“Principal Terms” (as defined in Section 5(e) below) of the New Team’s\noffer; and (ii) any non-Principal Terms of the New Team’s offer that the\nROFR Team is not required to match (as specified in Section 5(e) below)\nbut which would be included in the player’s Player Contract with the New\nTeam if the ROFR Team does not exercise its Right of First Refusal. The\nplayer’s obligation in the foregoing sentence to give to the ROFR Team a\ncompleted Offer Sheet shall be deemed satisfied if the Offer Sheet is given\nto the ROFR Team by the New Team. The Offer Sheet must be for a Player\nContract with a term of more than one (1) Season (not including any Option\nYear), unless the ROFR team has tendered the player both a Qualifying\nOffer and a Maximum Qualifying Offer, in which case the Offer Sheet must\nbe for a Player Contract with a term of more than two (2) Seasons (not\nincluding any Option Year). The Offer Sheet cannot be for a Two-Way\nContract. In order to extend an Offer Sheet, the New Team must have\nRoom for the player’s Player Contract at the time the Offer Sheet is signed\nand must continue to have such Room at all times while the Offer Sheet is\noutstanding.\n(c) The ROFR Team, upon receipt of the Offer Sheet, may exercise its\nRight of First Refusal, which shall have the consequences hereinafter set\nforth below in this Section 5. The ROFR Team may match an Offer Sheet\nby using, as applicable, Room, a Veteran Free Agent Exception set forth in\nArticle VII, Section 6(b), or the Minimum Player Salary Exception. In order\nto match an Offer Sheet, the ROFR Team must have, as applicable, Room,\na Veteran Free Agent Exception, or Minimum Player Salary Exception in an\namount equal or greater to the Salary plus any Unlikely Bonuses provided\nfor in the first Salary Cap Year of the player’s Contract at the time notice of\nthe Team’s exercise of its Right of First Refusal is given and must continue\nto have such Room or the applicable Exception at all times the First Refusal\nExercise Notice remains in effect.\nArticle XI\n323\n(d) The following rules shall govern the signing of an Offer Sheet by a\nRestricted Free Agent who has one (1) or two (2) Years of Service:\n(i)\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no\nsuch Offer Sheet may provide for Salary plus Unlikely\nBonuses in the first Salary Cap Year totaling more than the\namount of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception\nfor such Salary Cap Year. Annual increases or decreases in\nSalary and Unlikely Bonuses shall be governed by\nArticle VII, Section 5(a)(1).\n(ii)\nIf an Offer Sheet provides for the maximum allowable\namount of Salary for the first two (2) Salary Cap Years\npursuant to Section 5(d)(i) above, then, subject to\nSection 5(d)(iii) below, the Offer Sheet may provide for\nSalary for the third Salary Cap Year of up to the maximum\namount that the player would have been eligible to receive\nfor the third Salary Cap Year absent the restriction in the\nfirst sentence of Section 5(d)(i) above and had the player’s\nSalary for the first two (2) Salary Cap Years been the\nmaximum amount permitted under Article II, Section 7(a)\nand Article VII, Section 5(b)(1). If the Offer Sheet provides\nfor Salary for the third Salary Cap Year in accordance with\nthe foregoing sentence, then, subject to Section 5(d)(iii)\nbelow, (A) the player’s Salary for the fourth Salary Cap Year\nmay increase or decrease in relation to the third Salary Cap\nYear’s Salary by no more than four and five tenths\npercent (4.5%) of the Salary for the third Salary Cap Year,\n(B) the Offer Sheet cannot contain bonuses of any kind, and\n(C) the Offer Sheet must provide for one hundred\npercent (100%) of the Base Compensation in each Season to\nbe protected for lack of skill and injury or illness (with no\nindividually-negotiated conditions or limitations on such\nprotection).\n(iii)\nIf a Team extends an Offer Sheet in accordance with\nSection 5(d)(ii) above, then, for purposes of determining\nwhether the Team has Room for the Offer Sheet, the Salary\nfor the first Salary Cap Year covered by the Offer Sheet shall\nbe deemed to equal the average of the aggregate Salaries for\n324\nArticle XI\nsuch Salary Cap Year and each subsequent Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the Offer Sheet. If the ROFR Team does not\nexercise its Right of First Refusal, the player’s Salary for each\nSalary Cap Year covered by the Contract with the Team that\nextended the Offer Sheet shall be deemed to equal the\naverage of the aggregate Salaries for each such Salary Cap\nYear. If the ROFR Team exercises its Right of First Refusal,\nthe player’s Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by the\nContract with the ROFR Team shall be the Salary for such\nSalary Cap Year as set forth in the Contract.\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the sum of (A)\nthe ROFR Team’s Team Salary at the time it exercises its\nRight of First Refusal, and (B) the average of the aggregate\nSalaries for each Salary Cap Year of the Offer Sheet, is less\nthan or equal to the Salary Cap for the then-current Salary\nCap Year, then the ROFR Team may, in connection with\nexercising its Right of First Refusal, elect to have the player’s\nSalary for each Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract\nequal the average of such aggregate Salaries for each such\nSalary Cap Year. If the ROFR Team wishes to make such\nan election, it must do so by providing the NBA with a\nwritten statement on the same day that it gives the First\nRefusal Exercise Notice to the Restricted Free Agent and\nNew Team pursuant to Section 5(t) below, and the NBA\nshall provide a copy of this notice to the Players Association\nwithin one (1) business day following its receipt thereof.\n(e) The Principal Terms of an Offer Sheet are only:\n(i)\nthe term of the Contract;\n(ii)\nthe fixed and specified Compensation that the New Team\nwill pay or lend to the Restricted Free Agent as a signing\nbonus, Current Base Compensation, and/or Deferred Base\nCompensation in specified installments on specified dates;\n(iii)\nIncentive Compensation; provided, however, that the only\nelements of such Incentive Compensation that shall be\nincluded in the Principal Terms are the following:\n(A) bonuses that qualify as Likely Bonuses based upon the\nArticle XI\n325\nperformance of the Team extending the Offer Sheet and the\nROFR Team; and (B) Generally Recognized League\nHonors; and\n(iv)\nAny allowable amendments to the terms contained in the\nUniform Player Contract (e.g., Base Compensation\nprotection, a trade bonus, etc.).\n(f) In the event that an Offer Sheet includes an Exhibit 6 requiring that\nthe player pass a physical examination to be performed by a physician\ndesignated by the New Team, the Exhibit 6 language must be replaced with\nthe following: “This Offer Sheet will be deemed invalid and of no force and\neffect (except as described in Article XI, Section 5(l) of the CBA) unless the\nplayer passes, in the sole discretion of the Team (exercised in good faith), a\nphysical examination in accordance with Article II, Section 13(h) of the CBA\nthat is (i) conducted within two (2) days of the execution of this Offer Sheet,\nand (ii) the results of which are reported by the Team to the player within\nthree (3) days of the execution of this Offer Sheet. The player agrees to\nsupply complete and truthful information in connection with any such\nexaminations.” The New Team must notify the player and the ROFR Team\nwithin the three (3)-day period set forth in the Exhibit 6 in the Offer Sheet\nwhether the player has passed the physical. In the event that the New Team\nfails to timely provide such notice, the player shall be deemed to have passed\nthe physical with the New Team.\n(g) If the ROFR Team gives to the Restricted Free Agent a “First\nRefusal Exercise Notice” substantially in the form of Exhibit H annexed\nhereto (i) for an Offer Sheet received by the ROFR Team prior to 12:00 p.m.\neastern time on a day, by 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the day immediately\nfollowing such day, or (ii) for an Offer Sheet received by the ROFR Team\non or after 12:00 p.m. eastern time on a day, by 11:59 p.m. eastern time on\nthe day that is two (2) days following such day, then, subject to Section 5(k)\nbelow, such Restricted Free Agent and the ROFR Team shall be deemed to\nhave entered into a Player Contract containing all the Principal Terms (but\nnot any terms other than the Principal Terms) included in the Uniform\nPlayer Contract attached to the Offer Sheet (except that if the Contract\ncontains an Exhibit 6, such Exhibit 6 shall be deemed deleted). Such\nContract may not thereafter be amended in any manner for a period of\none (1) year.\n326\nArticle XI\n(h) If the ROFR Team does not give the First Refusal Exercise Notice\nwithin the applicable period specified in Section 5(g) above, or if during such\nperiod the ROFR Team provides written notice to the player that the Team\ndeclines to exercise its Right of First Refusal, then the player and the New\nTeam shall be deemed to have entered into a Player Contract containing all\nof the terms and conditions included in the Uniform Player Contract\nattached to the Offer Sheet (including, if the Offer Sheet contains an Exhibit\n6, that the player pass a physical examination to be conducted by the Team\nas a condition precedent to the validity of the Contract). Such Contract may\nnot thereafter be amended in any manner for a period of one (1) year.\n(i) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for any\nOffer Sheet received by the ROFR Team during the Moratorium Period, the\nROFR Team shall have until 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the July 7\nimmediately following such Moratorium Period to give the First Refusal\nExercise Notice.\n(j) After exercising its Right of First Refusal as described in this\nSection 5, the ROFR Team may not trade the Restricted Free Agent for\none (1) year, without the player’s consent. Even with the player’s consent,\nfor one (1) year, neither the ROFR Team exercising its Right of First Refusal\nnor any other Team may trade the player to the Team whose Offer Sheet\nwas matched.\n(k)\n(i)\nAny Team may condition its First Refusal Exercise Notice\non the player reporting for and passing, in the sole discretion\nof the Team (exercised in good faith), a physical examination\nto be conducted by a physician designated by the Team\nwithin two (2) days from its exercise of the Right of First\nRefusal. In connection with the physical examination, the\nplayer must supply all information reasonably requested of\nhim, provide complete and truthful answers to all questions\nposed to him, and submit to all examinations and tests\nrequested of him.\n(ii)\nIf the player does not submit to the requested physical\nexamination within two (2) days of the exercise of the Right\nof First Refusal, then the First Refusal Exercise Notice shall\nbe deemed no longer to be conditioned on the player\nArticle XI\n327\nreporting for and passing a physical examination and the\nfollowing rules shall apply:\n(1) In its sole discretion, the ROFR Team shall have two (2)\ndays following the conclusion of the two (2) day period\nreferenced in Section 5(k)(i) above to withdraw its First\nRefusal Exercise Notice. If the First Refusal Exercise\nNotice is timely withdrawn in accordance with the\nforegoing, such withdrawal shall have the following\neffects:\n(A) The Offer Sheet shall be deemed invalid and the\nTeam that issued the Offer Sheet shall be\nprohibited from signing or acquiring the player\nfor a period of one (1) year from the date the\nFirst Refusal Exercise Notice was withdrawn;\nprovided, however, that if the ROFR Team\nsubsequently relinquishes its Right of First\nRefusal (resulting in the player becoming an\nUnrestricted Free Agent) in accordance with\nSection 5(o) below, then the aforementioned\none-year prohibition shall be deemed to expire\non the last day of the Salary Cap Year in which\nthe invalidated Offer Sheet was signed by the\nplayer and the New Team;\n(B) The player shall be prohibited from entering into\nan Offer Sheet with any other Team prior to the\nfirst day of the Salary Cap Year immediately\nfollowing the Salary Cap Year in which the\ninvalidated Offer Sheet was signed by the player\nand the New Team;\n(C) If the deadline by which the player was given to\naccept the Qualifying Offer (and, if applicable,\nMaximum Qualifying Offer) provided to him by\nthe ROFR Team has not already expired, then\nsuch deadline shall be deemed to have expired\n(which shall have the effect of the player no\nlonger being able to accept the Qualifying Offer\n328\nArticle XI\n(or, if applicable, Maximum Qualifying Offer)\ngiven to him by the ROFR Team); and\n(D) (i) The player shall be prohibited from entering\ninto any Player Contract with the ROFR\nTeam other than a Player Contract\ncontaining all of the Principal Terms (but\nnot any terms other than the Principal\nTerms) included in the Uniform Player\nContract attached to the invalidated Offer\nSheet (except that such Player Contract may\ncontain an Exhibit 6) before the later of\n(A) three (3) months following the date the\nROFR Team withdrew its First Refusal\nExercise Notice, and (B) the January 15 of\nthe Salary Cap Year in which the invalidated\nOffer Sheet was signed by the player and the\nNew Team.\n(ii) In circumstances in which the invalidated\nOffer Sheet was signed pursuant to the rules\nset forth in Section 5(d)(ii) above (governing\nthe signing of certain Offer Sheets by\nRestricted Free Agents who have one (1) or\ntwo (2) Years of Service) and the player and\nthe ROFR Team sign a subsequent Player\nContract during the time period referenced\nin Section 5(k)(ii)(1)(D)(i) above:\n(A) solely for purposes of determining\nwhether the ROFR Team is eligible to\nsign the subsequent Player Contract with\nthe Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent\nException pursuant to Article VII,\nSection 6(b)(3)(ii) or the Non-Taxpayer\nMid-Level Salary Exception pursuant to\nArticle VII, Section 6(e)(5), the signing\nof such Player Contract shall be regarded\nas the matching of an Offer Sheet\nArticle XI\n329\nprovided in accordance with Article XI,\nSection 5(d)(ii); and\n(B) if, at the time the ROFR Team matched\nthe invalidated Offer Sheet, the ROFR\nTeam made an election pursuant to\nSection 5(d)(iii) above to have the\nplayer’s Salary for each Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the Contract equal the\naverage of the aggregate Salaries for each\nSalary Cap Year covered by the Contract,\nthen the ROFR Team shall be permitted\nto have the player’s Salary for each Salary\nCap Year covered by the subsequent\nContract equal the average of such\naggregate Salaries for each such Salary\nCap Year covered by the subsequent\nContract, provided that the sum of:\n(i) the ROFR Team’s Team Salary at the\ntime the subsequent Contract is signed;\nand (ii) the average of the aggregate\nSalaries for each Salary Cap Year of the\nsubsequent Contract is less than or equal\nto the Salary Cap for the then-current\nSalary Cap Year. If the ROFR Team\nwishes to make such an election, it must\ndo so by providing the NBA with a\nwritten statement on the same day that it\nsigns the subsequent Contract. The\nNBA shall provide a copy of any such\nnotice to the Players Association within\none (1) business day following its receipt\nthereof.\n(2) If the First Refusal Exercise Notice is not withdrawn by\nthe ROFR Team within the applicable two (2) day\nperiod, then the player and the ROFR Team shall be\ndeemed to have entered into a Player Contract in\naccordance with the provisions of Section 5(g) above.\n330\nArticle XI\n(iii)\nIf the player submits to the requested physical examination\nwithin two (2) days of the exercise of the Right of First\nRefusal but does not pass such physical examination, then in\nits sole discretion, the ROFR Team may withdraw its First\nRefusal Exercise Notice within two (2) days following the\ndate upon which such physical examination is conducted.

Such removal shall be effective immediately, provided that,\nunless otherwise agreed by the parties, such removal shall not affect any\nsecond opinion process involving such Physician that has previously been\nrequested by a player.\n(d) Prior to obtaining a second opinion, a player shall notify the Team\nin writing of his decision to seek such second opinion, the name of the\nphysician who will be performing the evaluation, and the date and location\nof the evaluation. Upon receiving such notice and prior to the player’s\nevaluation, the Team will make available to the physician relevant medical\ninformation regarding the player.\n(e) If, pursuant to subsections (a) through (d) above, a player obtains a\nsecond opinion from a Second Opinion Physician, the Team will pay the\nmedical costs associated with the second opinion provided such cost is\nreasonable for the consultation.\n(f) In connection with obtaining a second opinion from a Second\nOpinion Physician pursuant to subsections (a) through (e) above, a player\nmay not be absent from the Team for an unreasonable period of time or\nmiss any games without authorization of the Team.\n(g) If the Second Opinion Physician provides the Team with a written\nopinion, and the player has otherwise complied with Paragraph 7(h) of the\nUPC, the Team will be required to consider the second opinion in\n388\nArticle XXII\nconnection with diagnosis or treatment. For clarity, nothing in this\nSection 10 shall be construed to alter or limit in any way the rights of any\nTeam or the obligation of any player under the CBA or Uniform Player\nContract, including without limitation pursuant to the provisions of\nParagraph 7 of the Uniform Player Contract."

        "content": "(a) The parties shall establish panels of physicians (each a\n“Fitness-to-Play Panel”) for the purpose of determining, as set forth in this\nSection 11, whether players with potentially life-threatening injuries,\nillnesses, or other medical conditions (or any of the foregoing that have the\npotential to result in paralysis or other permanent spinal injury) are medically\nable and medically fit to practice and play basketball in the NBA. Each\nFitness-to-Play Panel shall consist of one (1) physician appointed by the\nNBA, one (1) physician appointed by the Players Association, and one (1)\nphysician appointed by agreement of the first two (2) physicians. Each\nmember of each Panel shall: (i) be board certified and fellowship trained in\nhis/her field of medical expertise; (ii) be a specialist in the subject matter of\nthe applicable Fitness-to-Play Panel; and (iii) have at least ten (10) years of\npost-fellowship clinical experience. Each Panel will operate by majority\nvote, including, but not limited to, its fitness to play determinations. Once\nappointed, each physician on a Fitness-to-Play Panel shall be included on\nsuch Panel for the duration of this Agreement, unless either the NBA or the\nPlayers Association has, by December 1 of any year covered by this\nAgreement, served written notice to the other party that a physician has been\nremoved from such Panel. A party may not remove the physician that the\nother party appointed to a Fitness-to-Play Panel. In the event that either\nparty removes a physician from a Fitness-to-Play Panel pursuant to the\nforegoing, such removal shall be effective immediately, provided that, unless\notherwise agreed to by the parties, a physician will continue to serve on the\nFitness-to-Play Panel in respect of any determination on a player’s injury,\nillness, or other medical condition that has been referred to the Panel but\nfor which the Panel has not yet issued its written determination.\n(b) The parties shall create one or more Fitness-to-Play Panels as are\nnecessary to address injuries, illnesses, or other medical conditions that are\npotentially life-threatening or have the potential to result in paralysis or other\npermanent spinal injury for the player (e.g., cardiac illnesses and conditions,\nblood clots, and other blood conditions and disorders).\nArticle XXII\n389\n(c) If the NBA, a Team, or the Players Association has been advised by\na physician that a player is medically unable and/or medically unfit to\nperform his duties as a professional basketball player as a result of a\npotentially life-threatening injury, illness, or other medical condition and/or\nthat performing such duties would likely create a materially elevated risk of\ndeath, paralysis, or other permanent spinal injury for the player, then the\nNBA, a Team, or the Players Association may refer the player to a\nFitness-to-Play Panel by making such a referral in writing to the player and\nto the NBA, Team, and Players Association, as applicable. Once so referred,\nthe player will not be permitted to play or practice in the NBA until he is\ncleared to do so by the Panel as set forth below.\n(d) (1)\nUpon the referral described in subsection (c) above, the\nPanel will be provided with all medical information in the\nplayer’s medical file that any member of the Panel deems\nrelevant to the injury, illness, or other medical condition for\nwhich the player was referred. The Panel will review the\nplayer’s injury, illness, or other medical condition (which\nreview shall include an in-person examination of the player\nby each member of the Panel unless such member\ndetermines that an examination by him/her would serve no\nuseful purpose). Upon conclusion of its review, the Panel\nshall provide a report to the NBA, the player’s Team, and\nthe Players Association setting forth its determination and\nthe reasons therefor.\n(2)\nThe determination to be made by the Panel is whether, in\nthe Panel’s reasonable medical judgment and experience,\nand having considered current medical knowledge and the\nbest available objective evidence: (i) the player is medically\nable and medically fit to perform his duties as a professional\nbasketball player; and (ii) performing such duties would not\ncreate a materially elevated risk of death, paralysis, or other\npermanent spinal injury for the player. Where there are\nauthoritative medical guidelines on fitness for athletic\nparticipation and a particular injury, illness, or other medical\ncondition (e.g., the American Heart Association/American\nCollege of Cardiology Scientific Statements on Eligibility\nand Disqualification – Recommendations for Competitive\n390\nArticle XXII\nAthletes with Cardiovascular Abnormalities), the Panel will\nconsider such guidelines in making its determination.\n(3)\nSubsequent to the player being referred to a Fitness-to-Play\nPanel, and prior to the Panel’s review of the player’s injury,\nillness, or other medical condition, the player (on behalf of\nhimself, his heirs, and assigns) shall be required to sign a\nrelease and covenant not to sue agreement in the form\nagreed upon by the parties; provided that this agreement\nshall not apply to any claim of medical malpractice against a\nTeam-affiliated physician or any physician retained by the\nNBA or Players Association for the medical evaluation\nprocess.\n(e) In the event that the Fitness-to-Play Panel determines that the player\nis medically able and medically fit to play professional basketball pursuant\nto the standard in subsection (d) above: (i) the player will be required to sign\nan informed consent and assumption of risk agreement in the form agreed\nupon by the parties before he is able to play or practice in the NBA; and\n(ii) upon satisfying the prior clause, shall be deemed at that time medically\nable and fit to play basketball in the NBA and permitted to do so.\n(f) If the Fitness-to-Play Panel does not determine that the player is\nmedically able and medically fit to play professional basketball pursuant to\nthe standard in subsection (d) above, the NBA, a Team, or the Players\nAssociation may again refer the player to the Fitness-to-Play Panel beginning\non the later of the first day of the Season that begins immediately following\nthe date on which the Panel issued its report or nine (9) months after such\ndate. The party making such referral must have been advised in writing by\na physician that there have been materially changed circumstances since the\nPanel issued its report (e.g., medical advances or a material change in the\nplayer’s medical condition) such that the Panel should reconsider its\ndetermination. If a player is referred under this subsection (f), the\nFitness-to-Play Panel shall be comprised of the same members that reviewed\nand determined the player’s initial referral, provided that the physicians on\nsuch panel are available.\n(g) Nothing in this Section 11 shall obligate a Team to permit a player\nto play or practice for the Team, even if a Fitness-to-Play Panel determines\nthat the player is medically able to do so. If the Team disagrees with the\nArticle XXII\n391\nFitness-to-Play Panel’s conclusion and refuses to permit the player to play\nand practice with the Team due to the injury, illness, or other medical\ncondition for which the player was referred to the Fitness-to-Play Panel,\nthen the Team will be required, within sixty (60) days of the Panel’s issuance\nof its report (or, if the report is issued during the period from the date that\nis sixty (60) days prior to the date of the NBA trade deadline through May\n31, then by August 1) (the “Evaluation Period”), to either trade the player,\nagree to amend the player’s Contract in accordance with Article II,\nSection 3(p) of the CBA, waive the player pursuant to Paragraph 16 of the\nUniform Player Contract, or waive the player pursuant to the “Partial Waiver\nProcedure” described in Section 11(i) below (a “Partial Waiver”); provided,\nhowever, that the foregoing shall not apply to any player who is in the last\nyear of his Contract (excluding any Option Year) at the time that the Panel\nprovides its report to the NBA, the player’s Team, and the Players\nAssociation pursuant to Section 11(d)(1) above. During the Evaluation\nPeriod, the player, shall cooperate with the Team in connection with the\nTeam’s efforts to evaluate the player’s injury, illness, or other medical\ncondition, including by, among other things, in a prompt and diligent\nmanner supplying all information requested of him, completing medical\nforms, and submitting to all examinations, tests, and workouts requested of\nhim by or on behalf of the Team.\n(h) If a player referred to a Fitness-to-Play Panel satisfies the waiting\nperiod set forth in Article VII, Section 4(h)(1) of the CBA at the time of\nsuch referral (or any time thereafter prior to the Panel issuing its report),\nthen the Team may request that such Panel, acting by majority vote, also\nserve as the physician described in Article VII, Section 4(h)(2) of the CBA,\nand accordingly provide in the Panel’s report a determination for the\npurposes of Article VII, Section 4(h) of the CBA.\n(i) In order for an eligible Team, pursuant to Section 11(g) above, to\ndesignate an eligible player’s Contract for a Partial Waiver, the Team must\nprovide written notice of such waiver and designation to the NBA. Once a\nTeam duly invokes the Partial Waiver Procedure, such procedure shall\noperate as follows:\n(i)\nThe waiver period shall be the same as the period for other\nwaivers.\n392\nArticle XXII\n(ii)\nAny Team other than the Team requesting the waiver may\nsubmit either a Full Waiver Claim or a Partial Waiver Claim\nfor the player. A “Full Waiver Claim” is a claim for the full\nvalue of the remaining term of the Contract pursuant to\nSection 5 of the NBA By-Laws. A “Partial Waiver Claim” is\na discount bid of a specified dollar amount (rounded to the\nnearest dollar) for a portion of the value of the remaining\nterm of the Contract. A Partial Waiver Claim can be for any\namount equal to or greater than the total of the applicable\nMinimum Player Salary for all of the Remaining Protected\nYears (as defined below) of the Contract and less than the\ntotal of the full Base Compensation provided for in all of the\nRemaining Protected Years of the Contract, provided that a\nPartial Waiver Claim may never be less than the total of the\nunprotected Base Compensation provided for in all of the\nRemaining Protected Years of the Contract. A “Remaining\nProtected Year” means any remaining year of the Contract\nthat contains any amount of Base Compensation protection\nthat is not contingent on some event occurring on a date\nafter the request for waivers; any remaining years of the\nContract that are not Remaining Protected Years shall\nhereinafter be referred to as “Remaining Unprotected\nYears.” For clarity, any Player Option Year in which the\nContract includes the language in Article XII, Section\n2(a)(A) and the Effective Season of an ETO shall be a\nRemaining Protected Year, and any Player Option Year in\nwhich the Contract that includes the language in Article XII,\nSection 2(a)(B) and any Team Option Year shall be a\nRemaining Unprotected Year.\n(iii)\nIn order to submit a Partial Waiver Claim, the Team must\nhave a Team Salary below the Salary Cap and room equal to\nat least the portion of the Claiming Team Base\nCompensation Obligation (as defined in subsection (vi)(A)\nbelow) plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to the first Year\nof the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract. For\npurposes of the preceding sentence, “room” includes room\nthat can be unilaterally created by the claiming Team (e.g., via\nrenouncements or waivers, but not via trades) and such\nArticle XXII\n393\nroom must be created immediately upon the awarding of the\nplayer pursuant to this waiver procedure.\n(iv)\nIf at least one (1) Full Waiver Claim is submitted during the\nwaiver period, the Contract shall be awarded to the Team\nsubmitting a Full Waiver Claim that is entitled to the highest\norder of preference in accordance with the waiver\nprocedures set forth in the NBA Constitution and By-Laws.\nIf no Full Waiver Claim is submitted and at least one (1)\nPartial Waiver Claim is submitted, the Contract shall be\nawarded to the Team submitting the highest Partial Waiver\nClaim in total dollars (or, if more than one (1) Team submits\nthe highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars, to the Team\nsubmitting the highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars\nthat is entitled to the highest order of preference in\naccordance with the waiver procedures set forth in the NBA\nConstitution and By-Laws).\n(v)\nIf there is no Full Waiver Claim or Partial Waiver Claim\nsubmitted for the Contract during the waiver period, the\nContract shall be terminated.\n(vi)\nIn the event that the Contract is awarded to a Team (the\n“Claiming Team”) as the result of a Partial Waiver Claim:\n(A)\nThe Claiming Team shall be responsible for payment\nof the player’s Base Compensation in an amount\nequal to the total dollar amount of the Partial Waiver\nClaim allocated over the Remaining Protected Years\nof the Contract in proportion to the Base\nCompensation amounts provided for in each\nRemaining Protected Year of the Contract (e.g., if the\nplayer has two (2) years remaining on his Contract\nwith $10 million of Base Compensation in year one\nthat is fully protected and $11 million of Base\nCompensation in year two that is fifty percent (50%)\nprotected and the winning Partial Waiver Claim was\nfor $6 million, the Claiming Team shall be\nresponsible for $2.86 million of the player’s Base\nCompensation in year one and $3.14 million in year\n394\nArticle XXII\ntwo) (the “Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation”).\nThe waiving Team shall be\nresponsible for paying the total Base Compensation\nin each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract\nless the Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation for each Remaining Protected Year of\nthe Contract (the “Waiving Team Base\nCompensation Obligation”). In addition to the\nClaiming Team Base Compensation Obligation, the\nClaiming Team shall also be responsible for the total\namount of all other Compensation obligations\ncontained in the Contract other than Base\nCompensation (including, but not limited to, the full\namount of any Incentive Compensation) and the\ntotal Base Compensation for any Remaining\nUnprotected Year.\n(B)\nThe Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation\nplus any Likely Bonuses applicable to each\nRemaining Protected Year of the Contract and the\ntotal Base Compensation plus any Likely Bonuses of\nany Remaining Unprotected Year shall be included\nin the Team Salary of the Claiming Team\nimmediately upon the awarding of the player to the\nClaiming Team pursuant to this waiver procedure.\n(C)\nThe Claiming Team may not trade a player awarded\nas a result of a Partial Waiver Claim until the July 1\nfollowing the award of the player’s Contract to the\nClaiming Team pursuant to this waiver procedure.\nIf a Claiming Team proposes to trade to another\nTeam a player awarded as a result of a Partial Waiver\nClaim (after the waiting period set forth in the\npreceding sentence) or if the Claiming Team\nsubsequently waives the player and another Team\nproposes to acquire such player in accordance with\nthe NBA waiver procedure, then: (i) for purposes of\ndetermining (a) whether the acquiring Team has\nRoom for the Contract, and (b) in the case of a trade,\nthe amount of any Traded Player Exception in\nArticle XXII\n395\nrespect of such player’s Contract, the player’s Salary\nshall be deemed to equal the Claiming Team Base\nCompensation Obligation plus any Likely Bonuses\napplicable to the then-current Salary Cap Year; and\n(ii) the acquiring Team shall thereafter be deemed\nthe Claiming Team for the purposes of this\nSection 11(i).\n(D)\n(vii)\nThe Claiming Team shall be responsible for making\nall payments to the player (and paying all related\npayroll taxes) other than Compensation due with\nrespect to any Season prior to the waiver. The\nwaiving Team shall reimburse the Claiming Team\nfor the portion of the Waiving Team Base\nCompensation Obligation applicable to each pay\nperiod on or before each applicable pay date.\nIn the event that the Contract is awarded to the Claiming\nTeam as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim and the Claiming\nTeam subsequently waives the player (a “Subsequent\nWaiver”) resulting in the termination of the Contract:\n(A)\nWithout taking into consideration any conditional\nBase Compensation protection triggered after the\ndate of the initial request for waivers but before the\nSubsequent Waiver (hereinafter referred to as\n“Triggered Base Compensation Protection”), if the\nContract contains full Base Compensation\nprotection in each of the Remaining Protected Years\nor if the Contract contains no Remaining Protected\nYears, the Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation and the Waiving Team Base\nCompensation Obligation shall remain unchanged.\n(B)\nWithout taking into consideration any Triggered\nBase Compensation Protection, if the Contract\ncontains partial protection in one (1) or more of the\nRemaining Protected Years, the Claiming Team Base\nCompensation Obligation and Waiving Team Base\nCompensation Obligation for each such year shall be\n396\nArticle XXII\nadjusted as follows upon the termination of the\nContract:\n(C)\n(1)\nThe Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation for any Remaining Protected\nYear that contains only partial Base\nCompensation protection shall be reduced\nby a number equal to the Claiming Team\nBase Compensation Obligation for that year,\ndivided by the total Base Compensation\nobligation for that year, multiplied by the\nunprotected Base Compensation remaining\nto be paid that year (the “Adjusted Claiming\nTeam Base Compensation Obligation”).\n(2)\nThe Waiving Team Base Compensation\nObligation for any Remaining Protected\nYear that contains only partial Base\nCompensation protection shall be reduced\nby a number equal to the Waiving Team\nBase Compensation Obligation for that year,\ndivided by the total Base Compensation\nobligation for that year, multiplied by the\nunprotected Base Compensation remaining\nto be paid for that year.\nThe full amount of any Triggered Base\nCompensation Protection shall be added to the\nAdjusted Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation in each remaining year of the Contract\nthat contains Triggered Base Compensation\nProtection.\n(j) The costs associated with the Fitness-to-Play Panels will be borne\nequally by the NBA and the Players Association, and the Players\nAssociation’s share shall be paid by the NBA and included in Player Benefits\nunder Article IV, Section 6(l) of this Agreement.\nArticle XXII\n397"

Subject to\nthe limits on Teams accessing information on certain players in accordance\nwith subsection (g) below, as with other medical history information, testing,\nand examinations from Combine Components, the NBA shall make any\nsuch report(s) from an orthopedic medical specialist available to the player\nand to Teams via the file in respect of the player in the EMR.\n(e) Based on available medical information, including the results of\nmedical testing at the Draft Combine, the NBA may require any player who\nwas invited to the Combine to undergo, by no later than the eleventh day\nbefore the date of the Draft, reasonable and appropriate follow-up testing\nor examination after the Draft Combine, as determined by the NBA’s\nmedical director for the Draft Combine in consultation with the player’s\ntreating physician (if any).\n402\nArticle XXII\n(f) A player shall fail to fulfill his obligation to participate in the Draft\nCombine in respect of a Draft, and shall therefore be ineligible to be selected\nin such Draft in accordance with Article X, Section 9 of the CBA, if he is\ninvited by the NBA to attend the Draft Combine and, as reasonably\ndetermined by the NBA in consultation with the Players Association, fails\nto fully participate in the Combine Components in which the player is\nrequired to participate pursuant to subsections (a)-(e) above.\n(g) The NBA shall organize and operate an annual process that utilizes\nthe following method (the “Top-10 Formula”) for the purpose of\ndeveloping a ranking of the top-10 players eligible in that year’s Draft:\ni.\nThe NBA (after consultation with the Players Association)\nshall annually select no fewer than (a) two (2) publications\nwith publicly-available pre-Draft rankings and (b) two (2)\nindividuals with relevant basketball experience (each such\nindividual, a “Combine Player Ranker”) for the purpose of\ngenerating the composite ranking described below.\nii.\nThe NBA shall utilize (a) from each such publication\nreferenced in subsection (i) above, its publicly-available\npre-Draft rankings, and (b) from each Combine Player\nRanker, his or her ranking of the top-fifteen players eligible\nin that year’s Draft.\niii.\nAny player who is ranked within the top-fifteen by one (1)\npublication and/or Combine Player Ranker, but not ranked\nwithin the top-fifteen by another publication and/or\nCombine Player Ranker shall, for purposes of computing the\nranking of such other publication(s) and/or Combine Player\nRanker(s), be given a ranking of sixteen (16). For clarity,\npursuant to the foregoing sentence, multiple players may be\ngiven such ranking of sixteen (16) for any publication and/or\nCombine Player Ranker that does not rank the player within\nthe top-fifteen (e.g., if two (2) or more players are ranked\nwithin the top-fifteen by one (1) publication and/or\nCombine Player Ranker, but not ranked as such by one (1)\nor more of the other publication(s) and/or Combine Player\nRanker(s)).\nArticle XXII\n403\niv.\nA composite ranking shall be determined by taking, for each\nplayer, the median ranking of each such publication’s\npublicly-available ranking and each such Combine Player\nRanker’s individual ranking provided to the NBA (such\nmedian ranking, the “Combine Player Ranking”).\nv.\nEach player whose Combine Player Ranking equals one of\nthe ten (10) lowest numbers (i.e., where 1 is the lowest\npossible sum that can be generated via the Top-10 Formula\nand thus the highest possible ranking for any player) shall be\nconsidered a top-10 player eligible in that year’s Draft. If\ntwo (2) or more players ranked first through tenth have the\nsame Combine Player Ranking, then the median ranking of\nthe publicly-available rankings from each publication\nreferenced in subsection (g)(i) above shall be used to\ndetermine each such player’s ranking (e.g., if two (2) players\nhave the same Combine Player Ranking, and such Ranking\nis higher than that of five (5) other players, then the player\nwith the lower median ranking of each such publication’s\npublicly-available ranking will be ranked sixth and the player\nwith the higher median ranking will be ranked seventh). If\nstill tied, then each such publication’s publicly-available\nranking and each Combine Player Ranker’s individual\nranking for each such player shall be aggregated, and the\nplayer with the lower total sum will be considered the higherranked player, followed by the player with the higher total\nsum. If still tied, the NBA shall conduct a random drawing\nto determine each such player’s ranking.\nvi.\nIf in any particular year covered by this Agreement the NBA\ndetermines that it is impracticable to calculate one or more\nof the rankings set forth in subsection (g)(i) above (e.g., due\nto the unavailability of a Combine Player Ranker, or if there\nare fewer than two (2) publications whose publicly-available\npre-Draft rankings are determined by the NBA (after\nconsultation with the Players Association) to be suitable for\nthis purpose), the NBA may, after consultation with the\nPlayers Association, generate an output of the Top-10\nFormula using as many of such publication(s)’ and/or\n404\nArticle XXII\nCombine Player Ranker(s)’ individual ranking(s) as is\nreasonably practicable.\nThe NBA shall finalize and provide to the Players Association the\nlist of players eligible in that year’s Draft who are ranked first\nthrough tenth per the Top-10 Formula. The NBA shall finalize such\nlist during the period beginning with the deadline established by the\nNBA under Article X, Section 1(b)(ii)(G) of the CBA to qualify as\nan Early Entry player and prior to the earlier of the date on which\n(x) the NBA conducts a drawing among the Teams that did not\nparticipate in the playoffs in the Season immediately preceding that\nyear’s NBA Draft to determine the order of selection positions in\nsuch NBA Draft, or (y) the on-site process to gather players’ medical\nhistory commences (i.e., the medical intake portion of the medical\nhistory referenced at subsection (a)(ii) above).\nThe information gathered from such players’ Combine Components set\nforth in subsection (a)(ii) above (and (a)(vi) above to the extent that any such\ntest or assessment involves medical information in respect of a player) shall\nbe made available by the NBA after it is gathered: (1) for the player ranked\nfirst, to Teams selecting first through tenth in that year’s Draft; (2) for the\nplayers ranked second through sixth, to Teams selecting first through\nfifteenth in that year’s Draft; (3) for the players ranked seventh through\ntenth, to Teams selecting first through twenty-fifth in that year’s Draft; and\n(4) for all other players invited to the Draft Combine, all Teams. For clarity,\nany assignee Team that trades for a Draft selection position within the top25 selection positions in that year’s Draft shall subsequently be given access\nto the information gathered from the Combine Components set forth in\nsubsection (a)(ii) above for each player associated with such Draft selection\nposition. Beginning on the day after the conclusion of the Draft, Teams will\nno longer have access to such information for any player whom a Team did\nnot select in the Draft (or whose Draft rights the Team does not hold).\n(h) Nothing in this Section 14 shall limit the right of the NBA, the\nPlayers Association, or a Team to refer a player eligible for a Draft, prior to\nthat year’s Draft, to a Fitness-to-Play Panel, in accordance with Article XXII,\nSection 11 of the CBA, if advised by a physician that the player is medically\nunable and/or medically unfit to perform his duties as a professional\nbasketball player as a result of a potentially life-threatening injury, illness, or\nother medical condition and/or that performing such duties would likely\nArticle XXII\n405\ncreate a materially elevated risk of death, paralysis, or other permanent spinal\ninjury for the player. In any such case, the fact that the player was referred,\nthe Panel’s determination, and all medical information in the player’s\nmedical file that any member of the Panel deemed relevant to the injury,\nillness, or other medical condition for which the player was referred shall be\nmade available to all Teams following the Panel’s determination.\n(i) For clarity, nothing in this Section 14 shall be construed to limit in\nany way (i) the right of a Team to request that a player eligible for a Draft\nvoluntarily participate in the administration of such activities described in\nsubsection (a) above (e.g., in connection with visiting a Team’s practice\nfacility during the period between the Draft Combine and the Draft) or\nprovide the Team with information, including information from the\nCombine Components described in subsection (a)(ii) above, or (ii) the right\nof a player to supplement medical information gathered from those\nCombine Components set forth in subsection (a)(ii) above with additional\ninformation that the NBA shall make available to all Teams via the EMR,\nsubject to subsection (g) above.\n(j)\n(i)\nTeams may use the results of information gathered from\nsuch Combine Components set forth in subsection (a)(ii)\nabove for Draft evaluation purposes only, and may not\ndiscuss any such results with representatives of any other\nTeam (regardless of whether the other Team would\notherwise have access to the same results); provided,\nhowever, that (1) medical staff from Teams entitled to access\nthe player’s information in accordance with subsection (g)\nabove may discuss such results with medical staff of other\nTeams who performed the medical examination of the\nplayer at the Draft Combine or in connection with\nsubsections (b), (c), or (e) above (for clarity, the only Team\npersonnel who will be involved in such examinations will be\nthose who are entitled to access the player’s information in\naccordance with subsection (g) above); (2) a Team may\ndiscuss such results with representatives from other Teams\nentitled to access the player’s information in accordance with\nsubsection (g) above if the player provides written consent\n(with notice to the Players Association); and (3) nothing in\nthis Section 14 shall limit any rights a Team has to use or\ndisclose such results in respect of a player who is under\n406\nArticle XXII\ncontract with the Team or as to whom the Team holds\nexclusive Draft rights (e.g., following the Draft, a team\ndisclosure of medical information in connection with a trade\nof a player’s Draft rights). For clarity, a Team will not have\nviolated this subsection (j)(i) to the extent its discussion\ninvolves only public information regarding a player.\n(ii)\nIf the NBA has reason to believe that the confidentiality\nrestriction set forth in subsection (j)(i) above has been\nviolated, it shall advise the Players Association in a timely\nmanner.\n(iii)\nIf the Players Association determines that the confidentiality\nrestriction set forth in subsection (j)(i) above has been\nviolated, it may bring a proceeding under Article XXXII,\nSection 1 of the CBA before the System Arbitrator. Upon a\nfinding by the System Arbitrator of a material violation, the\nSystem Arbitrator shall have the authority to impose on any\nTeam found to have committed such violation a fine of up\nto $1,000,000. In considering appropriate discipline for a\nviolation, the System Arbitrator shall take into account all\nrelevant factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of\nthe violation on the player, the degree of care demonstrated\nby the Team, and any ill intent regarding the player.\n(k) The NBA will consult with the Players Association in good faith on\n(i) creating a list of non-exclusive jointly-recommended interview questions\nto provide to Teams each year prior to the Draft Combine, and (ii) any issues\nthe Players Association raises relating to scheduling or operational details of\nthe Draft Combine (e.g., setting the dates and location of the Draft Combine,\nelements of the player experience at the Draft Combine).\n(l)\n(i)\nEach player invited to the Draft Combine will be provided\none (1) complimentary first class travel accommodations\n(except when such accommodations are not available) for\nhimself and one family member to the market in which such\nDraft Combine is held, and (2) one (1) complimentary\nindividual room in a group of hotel rooms reserved by the\nNBA for the Draft Combine. One certified agent who\nrepresents each such player participating in the Combine\nArticle XXII\n407\nshall (x) be permitted to reserve one (1) room in such group\nof hotel rooms (at such agent’s expense); and (y) receive an\nNBA credential at the Draft Combine to attend the on-court\nactivities set forth in subsection (a)(i) above; provided that if\nthe Players Association notifies the NBA that a player\nparticipating in the Draft Combine is represented by a\nsecond certified agent who does not already have an NBA\ncredential to attend the on-court activities set forth in\nsubsection (a)(i) above, such second agent shall receive such\ncredential.\n(ii)\nEach player invited to the Draft Combine will be offered an\nNBAGL contract covering the season immediately\nfollowing the Draft Combine. To benefit players, the NBA\nshall also undertake to provide new media opportunities at\nthe Draft Combine for players who attend and participate in\nthe Combine Components.\n(iii)\nMental health and wellness programming, jointly created by\nthe NBA and Players Association for players, will be\nincluded as part of the Pre-Draft Information Program\npresented at the Draft Combine.\n408"

The amount of the reduction in the First Team’s\nliability (the “set-off” amount) shall be calculated for each Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the term of the First Contract as follows:\nSTEP 1: Calculate the total compensation earned by the player (for services\nas a player) from the Subsequent Team(s) during the Salary Cap\nYear.\nSTEP 2: Subtract from the result in Step 1 (i) if the player had zero (0) Years\nof Service at the time the First Contract was terminated, the\nMinimum Annual Salary applicable to such player for the Salary\nCap Year in which the First Contract was terminated, or (ii) if the\nplayer had one (1) or more Years of Service at the time the First\nContract was terminated, the Minimum Annual Salary applicable\nto a player with one (1) Year of Service for the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich the First Contract was terminated.\nSTEP 3: If the result in Step 2 is zero (0) or a negative amount, there is no\nreduction in the First Team’s liability for unearned Base\nCompensation in respect of the relevant Salary Cap Year. If the\nresult in Step 2 is a positive amount, the reduction in the First\nTeam’s liability for unearned Base Compensation in respect of the\nrelevant Salary Cap Year shall equal fifty percent (50%) of such\namount.\nArticle XXVII\n421\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XXVII, a Team\nshall not be required to enforce its set-off right against a player in respect of\ncompensation earned by the player from any non-NBA Subsequent\nTeam(s). The First Team may require that the player provide the First Team\nwith evidence (such as a copy of the player’s new contract) of the\ncompensation to be earned by the player in connection with his services for\nany Subsequent Team(s).\n(b) For the purposes of this Article XXVII, (i) a “professional basketball\nteam” shall mean any team in any country that pays money or compensation\nof any kind to a basketball player for rendering services to such team (other\nthan a reasonable stipend limited to basic living expenses); and\n(ii) “compensation” earned by a player shall include all forms of\ncompensation (including, without limitation, any non-cash compensation)\nother than benefits comparable to the type of benefits (e.g., medical and\ndental insurance) provided to an NBA player in accordance with Article IV\nabove, travel and moving expenses, and any car and housing provided\ntemporarily by a professional basketball team to the player during the period\nof time for which the player renders services to such team. Notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in this Article XXVII, when a player receives\ncompensation from a non-NBA Subsequent Team on a net-of-tax basis,\nthen for purposes of calculating the amount of set-off to which the NBA\nTeam is entitled pursuant to this Article XXVII, such compensation from\nthe non-NBA Subsequent Team shall be deemed to equal the net-of-tax\ncompensation divided by 0.65 (reflecting a deemed thirty-five percent (35%)\ntax rate); provided, however, that such adjustment to the player’s\ncompensation from the non-NBA Subsequent Team shall not be made, or\nshall be modified accordingly, if the player can establish that taxes in respect\nof the player’s compensation calculated under this provision were not paid,\nor exceed the actual amount paid, by the player’s non-NBA Subsequent\nTeam.\n(c) Without limiting any other rights the First Team has, in the event a\nplayer’s Compensation is reduced pursuant to this Article XXVII and the\nTeam is unable to effect all or a portion of the reduction through payroll\ndeductions, the NBA shall have the right to direct any Subsequent Team\nthat is an NBA Team to withhold any unrecouped amounts from the\nplayer’s Compensation under his new Uniform Player Contract and remit\nsuch amounts to the First Team. To the extent such remedy is insufficient\nto effect a full recoupment of the set-off amount, the NBA and Players\n422\nArticle XXVII\nAssociation shall negotiate in good faith to agree on such supplemental\nmeasures as are appropriate to effect such recoupment."

(There is no set-off amount\nunder the First Contract in respect of the 2025-26 Season given these facts\nbecause the term of the Contract with Subsequent Team A does not cover\nthe 2025-26 Season.) Under these facts: (1) with respect to the 2023-24\nSeason, the player’s $3 million of protected Compensation under the First\nContract would be reduced by the applicable $600,000 set-off amount and\nhis reduced protected Compensation amount of $2.4 million would be\npayable in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in the First\nContract; (2) the player’s $6 million of protected Compensation under the\nFirst Contract in respect of the 2024-25 and 2025-26 Seasons would (absent\na right of set-off pursuant to this Article XXVII) be paid by the First Team\nat a rate of $1.2 million per Season over five (5) Seasons in accordance with\nthe mandatory stretch provision; and (3) as a result of the $600,000 set-off\namount to which the First Team is entitled in respect of the 2024-25 Season,\nthe $1.2 million stretched protected Compensation payments described in\n(2) above would each be reduced to $1.08 million (i.e., by $120,000 per\nSeason over the five-Season stretch period covering the 2024-25 through\n2028-29 Seasons).\n(Z) Assume the same facts as in example (Y) above and that on\nOctober 1, 2025, the player signs a Player Contract with Subsequent Team B\ncovering the 2025-26 Season and the set-off amount to which the First\nTeam is entitled under this Article XXVII in respect of such Contract is\n$500,000. In such case, the player’s aggregate then-remaining protected\nCompensation would be further reduced by the additional $500,000 set-off\namount such that the player’s remaining stretched protected Compensation\npayments that would (absent this additional right of set-off pursuant to this\nArticle XXVII) be paid by the First Team at a rate of $1.08 million per\nSeason over the remaining four (4) Seasons of the mandatory stretch period\nwould each be reduced to $955,000 (i.e., by $125,000 per Season over the\nfour-Season remaining stretch period covering the 2025-26 through 2028-29\nSeasons."
