      "content": "ROOKIE SCALE\nRookie Scale Contracts for First Round Picks.\n(a) Each Rookie Scale Contract between a Team and a First Round Pick\nshall cover a period of two (2) Seasons, but shall have an Option in favor of\nthe Team for the player’s third Season and a second Option in favor of the\nTeam for the player’s fourth Season. The Option for the player’s third\nSeason shall be exercisable during the period from the day following the last\nday of the first Season through the immediately following October 31. The\nOption for the player’s fourth Season shall be exercisable during the period\nfrom the day following the last day of the second Season through the\nimmediately following October 31. (For clarity, consistent with the rule set\nforth in Article XLII, Section 2, if October 31 in any year falls on a Saturday,\nSunday, or Federal Holiday, then the deadline for exercising Options in\nRookie Scale Contracts shall be deemed to fall on the following business\nday.) Such Options shall be exercisable by notice to the player that is either\npersonally delivered to the player or his representative or sent by email or\npre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of\nthe player or his representative, signed by the Team, informing the player\nthat the Team has exercised such Option.\n(b) (i)\nThe Rookie Salary Scale applicable to a First Round Pick is\ndetermined by the first Season to be covered by the player’s\nRookie Scale Contract. Accordingly, for example, if a\nplayer’s Rookie Scale Contract commences with the 2023-24\nSeason, the 2023-24 Rookie Salary Scale shall apply. Within\na particular Rookie Salary Scale, a First Round Pick’s\napplicable Rookie Scale Amounts are determined by the\nplayer’s selection number in the NBA Draft. Accordingly,\nfor example, the Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to the\neighth player selected in the first round of the NBA Draft\nshall be those specified in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale\nfor the eighth pick. Notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in this Section 1(b)(i) or in Section 1(b)(ii) below,\nbeginning on January 10 of each Season, an unsigned First\nRound Pick’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount for such\nSeason shall be reduced daily through the end of the Regular\nArticle VIII\n291\nSeason by an amount equal to the applicable Rookie Scale\nAmount (as set forth in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale)\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1)\nand the denominator of which is the total number of days in\nsuch Regular Season.\n(ii)\nNotwithstanding Section 1(b)(i) above, if, pursuant to any\nprovision of this Agreement or the NBA Constitution and\nBy-Laws, one (1) or more Teams is required to forfeit\none (1) or more draft picks in the first round of a particular\nNBA Draft, then:\n(A)\nthe Rookie Salary Scale for the Salary Cap Year\nimmediately following such Draft (or the Salary Cap\nYear of such Draft if the Draft occurs on or after\nJuly 1) shall be adjusted by removing one (1) or more\nRookie Scale Amounts from the middle of the\nRookie Salary Scale, as follows: if one (1) first round\npick is forfeited, then the Rookie Scale Amounts that\nwould have been applicable to the 15th player\nselected in the first round (absent any forfeiture of\npicks) (hereinafter, the “15th Pick”) shall be\nremoved from the Rookie Salary Scale; if two (2) first\nround picks are forfeited, then the Rookie Scale\nAmounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the pick\nimmediately following the 15th Pick shall be\nremoved from the Rookie Salary Scale; if three (3)\nfirst round picks are forfeited, then the Rookie Scale\nAmounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the picks\nimmediately preceding and immediately following\nthe 15th Pick shall be removed from the Rookie\nSalary Scale; and if more than three picks are\nforfeited, additional Rookie Scale Amounts shall be\nremoved from the Rookie Salary Scale in accordance\nwith the foregoing procedure; and\n(B)\nthe Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to players\nselected in such Draft shall be determined by their\nselection number under the Rookie Salary Scale as\nadjusted by Section 1(b)(ii)(A) above. Accordingly,\n292\nArticle VIII\nfor example, if one First Round Pick were forfeited\nin the first round of the 2024 Draft, the applicable\nRookie Scale Amounts would remain unchanged for\nthe first 14 picks, and the Rookie Scale Amounts\napplicable to the remaining 15 picks in the first\nround would be the Rookie Scale Amounts that\n(absent any forfeiture of picks) would have been\napplicable to picks 16 through 30.\n(c) (i)\nA Rookie Scale Contract shall provide in each of the two (2)\nSeasons covered by the Contract and the first Option Year\nfor Current Base Compensation of at least the greater of:\n(A) eighty percent (80%) of the applicable Rookie Scale\nAmount, and (B) the player’s applicable Minimum Player\nSalary. Components of Salary in excess of the foregoing\namount, if any, are subject to individual negotiation, except\nthat (1) in no event may Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for any\nSalary Cap Year exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%)\nof the applicable Rookie Scale Amount, and (2) a Rookie\nScale Contract may not provide for a signing bonus (except\nfor an “international player” payment in excess of the\nExcluded International Player Payment Amount made in\naccordance with Article VII, Section 3(e)) or a loan. A\nRookie Scale Contract may provide for a payment schedule\nin any Season that is more favorable to the player than that\ncalled for under Paragraph 3 of the Uniform Player\nContract, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.\n(ii)\nA Rookie Scale Contract must provide for Compensation\nprotection for lack of skill and injury or illness in each of the\ntwo (2) Seasons covered by the Contract and the first Option\nYear of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the applicable\nRookie Scale Amount. To the extent permitted by Article\nII, Section 4(l), a Team and a First Round Pick may negotiate\nadditional conditions or limitations applicable to the player’s\nBase Compensation protection, except that lack of skill and\ninjury or illness protection of at least eighty percent (80%)\nof the applicable Rookie Scale Amount in each of the first\ntwo (2) Seasons and the first Option Year shall contain no\nArticle VIII\n293\nsuch individually-negotiated additional conditions or\nlimitations.\n(iii)\nThe terms and conditions (other than with respect to the\npayment schedule for the player’s Base Compensation) that\napply to the second Option Year shall be unchanged from\nall terms and conditions that applied to the first Option Year\n(including, but not limited to, the percentage of Base\nCompensation that is protected), except that the Salary\n(excluding Incentive Compensation) and, if the Rookie Scale\nContract provides for Incentive Compensation for the first\nOption Year, then the amount of each bonus, for the second\nOption Year shall be increased over the Salary (excluding\nIncentive Compensation) and amount of each bonus,\nrespectively, for the first Option Year by the applicable\npercentage specified in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale.\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a trade\nof a Rookie Scale Contract would, by reason of a trade bonus contained in\nsuch Contract, cause the player’s Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the Salary\nCap Year in which such trade occurs to exceed one hundred twenty\npercent (120%) of the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount for such\nSalary Cap Year, such player’s trade bonus shall be deemed amended to the\nextent necessary to reduce the player’s Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for such\nSalary Cap Year to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the applicable\nRookie Scale Amount."
