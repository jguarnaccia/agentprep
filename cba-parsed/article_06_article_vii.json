provided, however, that\nthe determination of the amount, if any, to be included in\nBRI shall be made either (A) in accordance with the\nprovisions of Section 1(a)(4) below or (B) based upon direct\nevidence that the parties to the transaction had agreed that\ncertain revenues constituting arena-generated BRI would be\nforegone by the Team or Related Party, in direct exchange\nfor a thing of value as described above in this\nSection 1(a)(2)(xii), and provided, further that, when a\ndetermination is made pursuant to clause (B) of this\nSection 1(a)(2)(xii), the amount(s), if any, to be included in\nBRI shall be allocated (with an appropriate interest\nadjustment to reflect the time value of money where the\nthing of value received by the Team or Related Party is in\nthe form of cash or a cash equivalent, such as a check or wire\ntransfer) over the Salary Cap Years in which the\narena-generated BRI revenues foregone would have been\nreceived by the Team or Related Party (up to a maximum of\nfifteen (15) Salary Cap Years) and not on a lump-sum basis.\nWith respect to transactions involving payments asserted to\nfall within the exclusion in this Section 1(a)(2)(xii), the NBA\nwill provide the Players Association with the executed\nmemoranda of understanding, term sheet, or other such\nexecuted summary of terms, if any, for such underlying\ntransactions;\n(xiii)\nPayments made to Teams or to the NBA pursuant to the\nprovisions of Article VII, Section 12 (Designated Share\nArrangement) below;\n(xiv)\nDistributions, dividends or royalties paid by any\nNBA-related entity to owners, shareholders, members or\npartners;\n(xv)\nAny category or source of revenue or proceeds that was\nexpressly identified in any BRI Report (as defined in\n146\nArticle VII\nSection 10(b) below) or in any document or written\ncommunication (including debriefing memos) authored by\nthe Accountants and provided to the Players Association\nand the NBA (but excluding any underlying work papers) in\nconnection with the Audit Reports for any of the 1995-96\nthrough 2021-22 Salary Cap Years that was not included in\nBRI for such Salary Cap Years, unless such category or\nsource was included on the “open issues” list prepared by\nthe Accountants in connection with any of the Audit\nReports for the 2005-06 through 2021-22 Salary Cap Years,\nin which case such category or source shall be included in or\nexcluded from BRI, as the case may be, in accordance with\nthe other terms of this Article;\n(xvi)\nProceeds received by (A) Properties (and its related entities)\nthat were treated or, consistent with past practice, would\nhave been treated as within the scope of the Agreement\nbetween NBA Properties, Inc., and the National Basketball\nPlayers Association, dated as of September 18, 1995, as\namended January 20, 1999, July 29, 2005 and December 8,\n2011 (the “2011 Group License Agreement”) (including, but\nnot limited to, proceeds received pursuant to the license of\n“fantasy games,” which proceeds would have been included\nin the computation of Player Merchandise Revenues in\naccordance with the 2011 Group License Agreement), or\n(B) a League-related entity relating to the following\ncategories defined in the same manner as was used in the\naudited League Entities’ Combined Financial Statements for\nthe year ended September 30, 2021: (1) licensing, other than\nNet Licensing Revenues to the extent included in BRI\npursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(xviii), above; and/or (2) a\nLeague-related entity’s representation of, and services\nperformed for, third parties. For purposes of the foregoing\nsentence, “third parties” refers to persons or entities that are\nnot owned or controlled by persons or entities that own a\nmajority interest in or otherwise control an NBA Team or,\nif such third party is a Related Party, proceeds received by\nthe League-related entity shall not be included in BRI if\nrepresentation of such Related Party does not relate either\nto such entity’s NBA ownership or NBA Players;\nArticle VII\n(xvii)\n147\nMonies collected from Team-related fundraising for\ncharitable purposes or other charitable activities (including\nTeam-organized “50/50 raffles”), other than monies paid\npursuant to Team sponsorship agreements that are included\nin BRI pursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(v) above;\n(xviii) Proceeds solely related to the NBA 2K League, NBAGL and\nother leagues, teams and basketball organizations (e.g., an\ninternational league) that do not involve the playing of\nbasketball by any then-current NBA players;\n(xix)\nProceeds from the leasing or use of any Team physical assets\n(e.g., a Team plane);\n(xx)\nAny thing of value received from a concessionaire, food\nservice vendor or other third party equipment or service\nprovider that, if received in kind, is installed in an NBA arena\nor, if received in cash, is directed to defraying the costs of\nthe construction or substantial renovation of an NBA arena;\n(xxi)\nProceeds from businesses outside the arena (e.g., restaurants,\ncasinos, hotels, retail businesses, etc.), except for revenues\notherwise included in BRI for Team-identified stores. For\nclarity, the foregoing exclusion will not apply to revenues\nfrom the business operations of the NBA basketball team\nthat are otherwise includable as BRI under other provisions\nof this Agreement, including, without limitation, revenues\nreceived from sales of Team game tickets, media rights,\nsponsorships, signage outside the arena (subject to the\nlimitations set forth in Section 1(a)(1)(vi) above), and arena\nplaza game-day sales of novelties and concessions (subject\nto the limitations set forth in Section 1(a)(1)(v) above);\n(xxii)\nWithout limitation to any other basis for non-inclusion in\nBRI, BRI shall not include the value, if any, of (A) goods or\nservices that are operationally necessary to the performance\nof a contract, including, without limitation, certain ticketing\nplatforms and tools (e.g., Pricemaster, Presence, Open\nDistribution,\nArchtics,\nTicketmaster\nMarketplace,\n148\nArticle VII\nTicketmaster AccountManager), (B) product discounts, or\n(C) waived fees;\n(xxiii) Value, if any, attributable to data received by an NBA-related\nentity (or the right to receive such data), whether or not the\nprovision of such data is pursuant to a contractual\nobligation, other than amounts that are included in BRI\npursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(xx) above; and\n(xxiv) Value, if any, from contractual provisions (including but not\nlimited to those previously identified by the Players\nAssociation in connection with prior BRI audits) that require\nNBA or Team marketing partners to utilize the marketing\nrights purchased from an NBA-related entity in sponsorship\ndeals.\n(3) The parties agree that (i) in determining whether a category or\nsource of revenue or proceeds constitutes BRI: (A) consideration\nshall be given to whether such category or source is more similar in\nkind or nature to the included categories and sources listed in\nSection 1(a)(1)(i) through (xx) above, on the one hand, or to the\nexcluded categories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(2)(i) through\n(xxiv) above, on the other; and (B) no inference may be drawn from\nthe fact that such category or source was not included in the\ncategories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(1)(i) through (xx) above,\nor the fact that such category or source was not included in the\ncategories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(2)(i) through (xxiv)\nabove; and (ii) in any proceeding involving a dispute over (A) the\nincludability or categorization of any revenue or expense item for\nBRI purposes; (B) the amount to be included in or deducted from\nBRI with respect to any revenue or expense item; or (C) the\naccounting methodology used by the Accountants in connection\nwith any audit of BRI, the parties may refer to the past practice of\nthe parties or the Accountants in connection with the Audit Reports\nfor any of the 1999-2000 through 2021-22 Salary Cap Years;\nprovided, however, that no reference may be made to the past\npractice of the parties or the Accountants with respect to any source\nor category of revenue or expense that was included on the “open\nissues” list prepared by the Accountants in connection with any of\nsuch Audit Reports; provided, further, that any such past practice\nArticle VII\n149\nshall be superseded to the extent changed or clarified by the terms\nof this Agreement. In addition, no reference may be made, with\nrespect to expenses related to the NBA’s non-international business,\nto the fact that such category of expenses falls within\nSection 1(a)(14) below, to argue for the inclusion or exclusion of\nexpenses related to the League’s non-international business.\n(4) The parties agree that, with respect to any lease entered into\nafter the date of this Agreement between a Team (or a Related Party)\nand an arena that is not a Related Party, the Accountants may\nattribute to the Team (or a Related Party) for purposes of computing\nBRI for a Salary Cap Year portions of arena revenues received by\nthe arena or its related entities that would be included in BRI if\nreceived by the Team (or a Related Party) to the following extent: in\nthe event of a renewal, extension or renegotiation of a lease between\nthe same parties, or a new lease entered into by a Team (or a Related\nParty) with an arena that is not a Related Party, the Team will be\ndeemed to receive in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the new\nlease or by the renewal, extension or renegotiation of the existing\nlease (as the case may be) the greater of (i) the amount of such\nrevenues that the Team or the Related Party in fact receives under\nthe lease or, (ii) if in the opinion of the Accountants, the Team\n(and/or the Related Party) is receiving substantially less than fair\nmarket value as determined by the Accountants (taking into account\nfactors such as the rent paid by the Team or the Related Party, the\nnumber and identity of other major tenants in the arena, market\nconditions, the extent to which arena revenues are used to fund\nconstruction or renovations of the arena, and comparable lease\narrangements in the NBA), an amount determined by the\nAccountants to constitute the fair market value of the revenues that\na tenant, in the same circumstances as the Team or Related Party,\nwould receive for such Salary Cap Year. In either of the preceding\ncases, the Accountants will also determine the amount to be\nincluded in BRI for Salary Cap Years beyond the first Salary Cap\nYear.\n(5) (i) In no event shall the same revenues be included in BRI,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result\nof changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose\nof this provision being to preclude the double-counting of\n150\nArticle VII\nrevenues, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap\nYears.\n(ii)\nIn no event shall the same expenses be deducted from BRI,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result\nof changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose\nof this provision being to preclude the double-counting of\nexpenses, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap\nYears.\n(6) Subject to Section 11 below (Players Association Audit Rights):\n(i)\nWith respect to expenses incurred in connection with all\nproceeds coming within Section 1(a)(1)(v) above, all\nreported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be\nreasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be\nthe subject of the accounting procedures set forth in Section\n10 below.\n(ii)\nWith respect to expenses incurred in connection with all\nproceeds coming within Section 1(a)(1)(ix) above that are\nconsistent with the types and categories of expenses incurred\nby Properties as reflected in the audited financial reports of\nProperties for the year ended July 31, 1994, (1) all such\nreported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be\nreasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be\nthe subject of the accounting procedures set forth in Section\n10 below, but (2) such expenses shall be disallowed to the\nextent they exceed the ratio of expenses to revenues for the\ncategory of revenues set forth in Exhibit D hereto.\n(iii)\nWith respect to the NBA Store (the “Store”) and any other\nnew venture or business (whether or not involving the\ncreation of a new entity) undertaken by the NBA, Properties,\nMedia Ventures, or any other League-related entity requiring\nsignificant capital investment or start-up costs (“New\nVenture”), the League-related entities shall be able to deduct\nfrom BRI reasonable and customary expenses related\nthereto, including, but not limited to, cost of goods sold,\nsales tax, all reasonable operating expenses of the Store or\nArticle VII\n151\nNew Venture (including, but not limited to, salaries and\nbenefits directly related to the operations of the Store or\nNew Venture, promotional and advertising costs, rent, direct\noverhead, general and administrative expenses of the Store\nor New Venture), reasonable financing costs and\namortization of capital improvements and start-up costs;\nprovided, however, that in no event shall the expenses\nattributable to the Store or New Venture cause the amount\nincluded in BRI for the Store or New Venture to be less than\nzero (0) for any Salary Cap Year.\n(iv)\nWith respect to miscellaneous BRI or new categories of BRI\n(other than revenues attributable to the Store or a New\nVenture), the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, other\nLeague-related entities, Teams and Related Parties shall be\nable to deduct all reasonable and customary expenses\n(including reasonable and customary Taxes), including, for\nexample, in connection with All-Star Weekend, subject to\nthe terms of this Section 1(a)(6).\n(v)\nIn each Salary Cap Year, except for (A) Team Content\nRevenues and Team Content Expenses (as defined below)\nand (B) Playoff-Related Revenues and Expenses (as defined\nbelow), all Team and Related Party revenues included in, and\nall Team and Related Party expenses deducted from, BRI are\nsubject to an aggregate uniform percentage-of-revenues\nexpense cap of eleven and one-tenth percent (11.1%) (see\nalso Exhibit D hereto), with any such expenses disallowed\nto the extent they exceed that cap. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, for the 2021-22 Salary Cap Year, the total Team and\nRelated Party revenues and expenses that would have been\nsubject to the new eleven and one-tenth percent (11.1%)\nexpense cap were the amounts identified in the parties’ letter\nagreement, dated June 28, 2023. For the purposes of this\nArticle VII, Section 1, (1) “Team Content Revenues” and\n“Team Content Expenses” mean, respectively, revenues and\nrelated expenses from local TV, cable, and Team direct-toconsumer media and (2) “Playoff-Related Revenues and\nExpenses” means the revenues and expenses reported in the\n“playoff gate receipts, net” amount shown in the Audit\n152\nArticle VII\nReport for the 2015-16 Salary Cap Year. Team Content\nRevenues, Team Content Expenses, and Playoff-Related\nRevenues and Expenses are not subject to the above\nuniform expense cap. Team Content Expenses will be\ndeductible and uncapped, and will include, without\nlimitation those expenses identified in the parties’ letter\nagreement, dated June 28, 2023. Playoff-related expenses\nwill continue to be deductible in accordance with the terms\nof the 2011 CBA as reflected in the Audit Report for the\n2015-16 Salary Cap Year. For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes\nwill be deducted from revenues included in BRI under\nSections 1(a)(1)(i), (iii), (vi), (vii), (viii), (x), (xi), (xiii), (xiv),\n(xviii), and (xix) (to the extent set forth in those subsections)\nbefore the application of the eleven and one-tenth percent\n(11.1%) ratio in calculating the uniform expense cap, and\nbefore the deduction of expenses.\n(vi)\nTo the extent that, for a Salary Cap Year, total Team Content\nExpenses and League Content Expenses (inclusive of\nNBAE and ITV expenses after application of caps) exceeds\nthe product of Team Content Revenues and League Content\nRevenues (inclusive of NBAE and ITV revenues) multiplied\nby the Rollover Ratio (as defined below), that excess would\nbe amortized over such Salary Cap Year and the next two\nSalary Cap Years. The “Rollover Ratio” shall be eighteen\nand one-half percent (18.5%), except that, beginning in the\n2026-27 Salary Cap Year, the Rollover Ratio shall be the\nhigher of (A) eighteen and one-half percent (18.5%) or\n(B) the highest actual ratio of Team Content Expenses and\nLeague Content Expenses to Team Content Revenues and\nLeague Content Revenues in any of the preceding Salary Cap\nYears under the CBA. Any amortized amount would be\nexcluded from each Salary Cap Year’s rollover threshold\ncalculation. An imputed interest rate equal to the 1-month\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.225% (calculated\nas of the July 1 of the Salary Cap Year during which such\ninterest accrues) will be applied on amortized amounts and\nrecouped in each Salary Cap Year in which amounts are\namortized. For the purposes of this Article VII, Section 1,\n“League Content Revenues” and “League Content\nArticle VII\n153\nExpenses” mean, respectively, revenues and expenses\nrelated to all NBA and League-related content categories of\nBRI, including Digital, International League Pass (DBS),\nNBAE, ITV, Media Ventures, Radio, and National TV. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, League Content Expenses will\nremain deductible and, with the exception of NBAE and\nITV, uncapped.\nFor example, if, in the 2025-26 Salary Cap Year, the sum of\nTeam Content Revenues and League Content Revenues\nwere $5 billion, and the sum of Team Content Expenses and\nLeague Content Expenses (after application of caps on\nNBAE and ITV expenses) were $1 billion, and the imputed\ninterest rate calculated pursuant to this Section 1(a)(6)(vi)\nwere four percent (4%), then the amortized amount would\nbe $75 million (i.e., $1 billion – $925 million (i.e., 18.5% of\n$5 billion)). $25 million of the amortized amount would be\ndeducted from BRI in the 2025-26 Salary Cap Year. In the\n2026-27 Salary Cap Year, the amortized amount to be\ndeducted from BRI in respect of the 2025-26 Salary Cap\nYear would be $26 million (i.e., $25 million, grown at four\npercent (4%) interest per Salary Cap Year for one Salary Cap\nYear). In the 2027-28 Salary Cap Year, the amortized\namount to be deducted from BRI in respect of the 2025-26\nSalary Cap Year would be $27.04 million (i.e., $25 million,\ngrown at four percent (4%) interest per Salary Cap Year for\ntwo Salary Cap Years).\n(7) It is acknowledged by the parties hereto that for purposes of\ndetermining BRI:\n(i)\nSome NBA Teams have engaged or may engage in\ntransactions with third parties that control, or own at least\nfifty percent (50%) of, the NBA Team or that are controlled\nor owned at least fifty percent (50%) by the persons or\nentities controlling or owning at least fifty percent (50%) of\nthe NBA Team (such third parties are referred to in this\nAgreement as a “Related Party”), and Related Parties\nthemselves engage in transactions with third parties that may\nresult in a Related Party’s receipt of revenues that constitute\n154\nArticle VII\nBRI. (Any entity that was an “entity related to an NBA\nteam” as defined by Article VII, Section 1(a)(4)(i) of the\nSeptember 18, 1995 Collective Bargaining Agreement\nbetween the NBA and the Players Association (the “1995\nCBA”) shall be deemed a Related Party under this\nAgreement for so long as such entity continues to be an\nentity related to an NBA Team within the meaning of the\n1995 CBA.) As provided in Section 1(a)(1) above, the\nrelevant proceeds received by any Related Party that come\nwithin such subsection and that relate to such Related Party’s\nTeam shall be included in BRI. However, except in\nconnection with telecast agreements (which are subject to\nSection 1(a)(7)(ii) below), with respect to any such revenues\nor proceeds retained or received by a Related Party (other\nthan arena revenues that relate to such Related Party’s Team\nincluding, but not limited to, in-arena sales of novelties and\nconcessions, NBA game parking, arena club revenues, suite\nand seat revenues and fixed and temporary in-arena signage,\nwhich shall be included in BRI as if received by the Team),\nor by a Team pursuant to a transaction with a Related Party,\nsuch revenues or proceeds shall be included in BRI only to\nthe extent that the NBA and the Players Association agree\nor, if they fail to agree, the Accountants shall reasonably\ndetermine the amount, if any, of such revenues or proceeds\nto attribute to the Team (taking into account factors such as\nthe nature of the transaction, arrangement and/or\nrelationship between the Team and the Related Party or\nbetween the Related Party and a third party, any amounts\nincluded in BRI with respect to other Teams (or Related\nParties) that have entered into comparable transactions,\narrangements and/or relationships with third parties, market\nconditions, the nature of any services or activities performed\nby the Related Party for, or in connection with, the\ngeneration of revenues or proceeds and the amount of\nrevenues or proceeds that the Related Party would be\nexpected to retain or receive with respect to comparable\ntransactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third\nparties), and the amount so attributed shall be the only\namount included in BRI. To the extent that the amount of\nsuch proceeds to be included in BRI cannot reasonably be\nArticle VII\n155\ndetermined with respect to any particular transaction, the\nAccountants shall determine a reasonable amount with\nrespect to such transaction, which shall be included in BRI.\n(In the event the Accountants refuse to make any such\ndetermination, such determination shall be made by a jointly\nselected expert with respect to any such transaction.)\nWithout limiting the foregoing, in no event shall BRI include\nconsideration paid to a Related Party in connection with\nrights acquired by such Related Party from a Team for fair\nmarket value, even if such consideration relates to NBA\ngames or NBA-related activities (including, by way of\nexample and not limitation, advertising revenue or\nsubscriber fees earned by a Related Party television network\nthat relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of NBA\ngames licensed to the television network by a Team).\n(ii)\nIn the event that, following the execution of this Agreement,\na Team (other than the New York Knicks (“Knicks”)) enters\ninto a local or regional telecast agreement with a Related\nParty, a copy of such agreement shall be provided to the\nPlayers Association within ten (10) days of approval of such\nagreement by the NBA. The Players Association and the\nNBA shall each have the right, not later than ten (10) days\nfollowing the date on which the Players Association receives\na copy of such agreement, to submit such agreement to a\njointly-selected television valuation expert or (in the absence\nof such agreement) determined in accordance with the\nprocedure set forth in this subsection (“TV Expert”) for the\nlimited purpose set forth in this Section 1(a)(7)(ii). In the\nevent that a party has so elected to submit such agreement\nto a TV Expert and the parties have not jointly selected a TV\nExpert within twenty (20) days following the date on which\nthe Players Association receives a copy of such agreement,\neach party shall appoint its own television valuation designee\nand the two designees so appointed shall within ten (10) days\nof their appointment, jointly select a third party to serve as\nthe TV Expert. Such TV Expert shall review such\nagreement to determine if the aggregate amount to be paid\nto the Team by the Related Party for the rights to telecast\nthe Team’s games pursuant to such agreement is more than\n156\nArticle VII\nfifteen percent (15%) above or more than fifteen percent\n(15%) below the fair market value of such rights over the\nterm of such agreement. In making such determination, the\nTV Expert may take into account factors such as the nature\nof the transaction, arrangement and/or relationship between\nthe Team and the Related Party, any amounts included in\nBRI with respect to other Teams (or Related Parties) that\nhave entered into comparable transactions, arrangements\nand/or relationships with other programming licensors,\nmarket conditions, the nature of any services or activities\nperformed by the Related Party for, or in connection with,\nthe generation of revenues or proceeds and the amount of\nrevenues or proceeds that the Related Party would be\nexpected to retain or receive with respect to comparable\ntransactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third\nparties; provided that in no event shall BRI include\nconsideration paid to a Related Party in connection with\nrights acquired by such Related Party from a Team for fair\nmarket value, even if such consideration relates to NBA\ngames or NBA-related activities (including, by way of\nexample and not limitation, advertising revenue or\nsubscriber fees earned by a Related Party television network\nthat relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of NBA\ngames licensed to the television network by a Team). In the\nevent that the TV Expert determines that such aggregate\namount is more than fifteen percent (15%) above or below\nfair market value, the TV Expert shall be instructed to\nsubmit to the parties the amount for each Season of such\nagreement that he determines reflects the fair market value\nof such rights and such amounts, and no other amounts,\nshall be included in BRI with respect to such agreement for\neach Salary Cap Year covered by such agreement. Any\ndetermination made by the TV Expert pursuant to either of\nthe preceding two sentences shall be submitted to the parties\nno later than twenty (20) days from the date on which such\nagreement was submitted to the TV Expert for his review.\nAny fees or costs associated with the retention or\ndetermination of the TV Expert shall be borne equally by\nthe Players Association and NBA. The Players Association\nand the TV Expert shall maintain the confidentiality of any\nArticle VII\n157\nsuch agreement (and any determination made by the TV\nexpert in accordance with this Section 1(a)(7)(ii)) pursuant\nto the terms of Section 11(c) below relating to the\nconfidentiality of BRI Audits.\n(iii)\nWith respect to the transactions listed below in this\nSection 1(a)(7)(iii), the parties agree that, because the\nproceeds attributable to these transactions cannot be\naccurately ascertained, the following procedures shall be\nused for each NBA Season in which MSG Network is a\nRelated Party of the Knicks (in the case of\nSection 1(a)(7)(iii)(A) below) and the Madison Square\nGarden arena is a Related Party of the Knicks (in the case of\nSection 1(a)(7)(iii)(B) below):\n(A)\nNew York Knicks transaction with MSG Network\nregarding the sale of local media rights: BRI for the\nKnicks for each NBA Season covered by this\nAgreement shall include an amount equal to the net\nproceeds included in BRI attributable to the Los\nAngeles Lakers’ sale, license or other conveyance of\nall local media rights (including, but not limited to,\nbroadcast and cable television and radio) for such\nNBA season.\n(B)\nNew York Knicks transactions with Related Parties\ninvolving signage: BRI for the Knicks for the\n2021-22 NBA Season shall include $16,560,026 for\nsignage. In each subsequent Season covered by this\nAgreement, this amount shall be increased (or\ndecreased, as the case may be) by the League-wide\npercentage increase (or decrease) in signage as\ndetermined in accordance with Sections 1(a)(1)(v)\nand (a)(1)(vi) above.\nAt such time as the MSG Network and/or the\nMadison Square Garden Arena are no longer Related\nParties, BRI for the New York Knicks in the\ncategories described in Section 1(a)(7)(iii)(A) and/or\n(B) above, as the case may be, shall not be\n158\nArticle VII\ndetermined in accordance with the foregoing and\nwill instead be determined by the applicable\nprovisions of Sections 1(a)(1) and (a)(7)(ii) above.\n(8) In the event that, pursuant to the NBA’s national broadcast,\nnational telecast and network cable television agreements, NBA\nTeams receive revenue sharing proceeds that are attributable to\nNBA game telecasts in more than one Salary Cap Year, such\nproceeds shall be allocated over the same number of Salary Cap\nYears (beginning with first Salary Cap Year after the Salary Cap Year\nin which such proceeds are actually received) as the number of Salary\nCap Years in which such games were televised. Any other\ncontingent payments received by the NBA pursuant to such\nagreements shall be included in BRI to the extent and in a manner\nagreed upon by the parties, or, if the parties cannot agree, in a\nreasonable manner determined by the Accountants.\n(9) The NBA and each NBA Team shall in good faith act and use\ntheir commercially reasonable efforts to increase BRI for each Salary\nCap Year during the term of this Agreement. In the exercise of such\ncommercially reasonable efforts, the NBA and each NBA Team\nshall be entitled to act in a manner consistent with their reasonable\nbusiness judgment and shall not (i) take any action intended to\nbenefit, at the expense of BRI, other commercial activities (such as\nthe WNBA and the NBAGL) unrelated to the performance of\nPlayers in NBA basketball games or in NBA-related activities, or\n(ii) shift or forgo revenues attributable to Salary Cap Years during\nthe term of this Agreement in exchange for revenues or benefits\nduring Salary Cap Years following the expiration of this Agreement\n(unless there is a reasonable business justification unrelated to\ncollective bargaining for such shift or forgoing). There shall be no\nobligation on the part of the NBA or any NBA Team to accelerate\ninto Salary Cap Years within the term of this Agreement revenues\nattributable to Salary Cap Years following the expiration of this\nAgreement. In evaluating compliance with this subsection, the\nparties and the System Arbitrator shall consider and give substantial\nweight to the reasonable business judgment of the NBA or the NBA\nTeam but no deference will be applied where the NBA is alleged to\nhave shifted or forgone revenues of $350 million or more for the\npurpose of securing leverage in collective bargaining, in which case\nArticle VII\n159\nany finding of non-compliance shall require proof by a clear\npreponderance of the evidence. The following is a list of decisions\nin respect of which the business judgment of the NBA or an NBA\nTeam shall conclusively be deemed reasonable: membership\nlocation; arena capacity or configuration; number and location of\ngames played; whether to outsource or operate a line of business;\nand whether to accept or decline a sponsorship, advertising or\nnaming rights opportunity. The foregoing list shall not limit in any\nmanner the circumstances in which the business judgment of the\nNBA or an NBA Team may be deemed reasonable.\n(10) The parties agree that upon a finding by the System Arbitrator\n(which, if appealed, is affirmed by the Appeals Panel) that the NBA\nor an NBA Team (or a Related Party) has willfully failed to provide\nto the Accountants information concerning revenues or expenses\nmaterial to the Accountants’ preparation of an Audit Report, and\nthat such failure to provide information resulted in an\nunderstatement of BRI of more than $5,511,614 with respect to the\n2023-24 Salary Cap Year (increasing by four and one-half percent\n(4.5%) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year of this Agreement,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year), then the amount by\nwhich BRI was understated shall be included in BRI in the Salary\nCap Year in which such finding is made, with interest accruing from\nthe date of the Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year in which such\namount would have been included but for such understatement,\nwith interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as\npublished in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the issuance of\nsuch Audit Report). In addition, if any Team, or if the NBA, violates\nthe foregoing, it shall be fined $3 million for its first violation during\nthe term of this Agreement and an additional $1.5 million for each\nadditional violation. (For example, if a Team violates the foregoing\nfor the first time, it shall be fined $3 million; if such Team violates\nthe foregoing a second time, it shall be fined $4.5 million; and if such\nTeam violates the foregoing a third time, it shall be fined $6 million.)\nFifty percent (50%) of any such fine amounts shall be remitted by\nthe NBA to an NBPA-Selected Charitable Organization (as defined\nin Article VI, Section 6 above) and fifty percent (50%) shall be\nremitted by the NBA to a Section 501(c)(3) Organization selected\nby the NBA.\n160\nArticle VII\n(11) Neither the NBA or a League-related entity nor a Team or a\nRelated Party will enter into any lease or other agreement providing\nfor the receipt of revenues includable in BRI that contains\nprovisions that purport to limit access of the Accountants to the\nbooks and records of the NBA, such League-related entity, such\nTeam, or such Related Party in a manner inconsistent with the terms\nof this Agreement or that would preclude the calculation of revenues\n(if any) to be included in BRI pursuant to the provisions of\nSection 1(a)(1)(xii) above.\n(12) Premium payments made by a Team for any insurance that, if\npaid, would be includable in BRI pursuant to Section 1(a)(2)(ix)\nabove, shall be deducted from such Team’s BRI for the Salary Cap\nYear in which any such insurance recovery is received.\n(13) Equity Transactions.\n(i)\nThe value of equity securities received by NBA-related\nentities (as defined in Section 1(a)(2) above) in entities that\nwere not NBA-related entities prior to such receipt, to the\nextent otherwise constituting BRI under this Agreement,\nshall be included in BRI as follows:\n(A) if the equity securities (including contingent securities,\nas defined below) are Publicly Tradable when received,\nthe Publicly Traded Value of those securities will be\nincluded in BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich they are received;\n(B)\nif the equity securities consist of options, warrants,\nconvertible securities or similar securities (“contingent\nsecurities”), and (x) those contingent securities are\nsold, the Net Proceeds will be included in BRI\ncommencing in the Salary Cap Year in which the sale\noccurs, or (y) those contingent securities are exercised\nor converted into other securities that are or become\nPublicly Tradable, the Publicly Traded Value of the\nresulting securities (net of any exercise or conversion\nprice and taxes, as determined below) will be included\nin BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which\nArticle VII\n161\nthe exercise or conversion occurs (if the resulting\nsecurities were Publicly Tradable at that time) or in the\nSalary Cap Year in which the resulting securities later\nbecome Publicly Tradable, whichever is first;\n(C)\nif the equity securities (including contingent securities\nand any securities resulting from the exercise or\nconversion of contingent securities) are not Publicly\nTradable at the time of receipt (or, in the case of\ncontingent securities, at the time of exercise or\nconversion), no BRI value shall be attributable to such\nsecurities until (x) they become Publicly Tradable or\nare sold or otherwise transferred for consideration\nother than securities that are not Publicly Tradable,\nwhichever is first, at which time the Publicly Traded\nValue or Net Proceeds, as applicable, will be included\nin BRI commencing in the Salary Cap Year in which\nsuch event occurs or (y) they are specifically pledged\nand valued as part of a transaction that provides\nliquidity without selling the equity position, even if\nother assets are also pledged as a part of such\ntransaction, in which case BRI will include an amount\nequal to the specific value assigned to the equity\nsecurities (“Specifically Assigned Value”) commencing\nin the Salary Cap Year in which they are specifically\npledged and valued; or\n(D) notwithstanding the foregoing, if any contingent\nsecurities are exercisable or convertible into securities\nthat are or become Publicly Tradable, but those\ncontingent securities are not exercised or converted\nwithin one (1) year of any such right, the Players\nAssociation shall have the right, by written notice to\nthe NBA, to have the Publicly Traded Value of such\nsecurities included in BRI as if those contingent\nsecurities had been exercised or converted on the date\nof such notice (net of any exercise or conversion price\nand taxes, as determined below).\n162\nArticle VII\n(ii)\nFor purposes of this Section 1(a)(13), (A) “Publicly\nTradable” means (x) the applicable equity securities have\nbeen registered for sale under applicable state, federal and\nforeign laws, are listed and tradable on a generally recognized\nstock exchange or in the over-the-counter market, or (y) the\napplicable equity securities can be readily purchased and sold\non a nationally recognized secondary market (e.g., without\nlimitation on any example, shares in “Facebook” as of the\ndate of the 2011 CBA), and in each case under (x) and (y),\nany contractual or other prohibition or limitation on sale\nwould not preclude a sale; (B) “Publicly Traded Value”\nmeans the weighted average daily trading price of the\napplicable equity securities for the thirty (30) trading days\n(x) preceding the date of receipt if the securities are Publicly\nTradable prior to that date or (y) following the date they\nbecome Publicly Tradable; provided that if such equity\nsecurities are sold during the Salary Cap Year in which their\nPublicly Traded Value is first included in BRI, the “Publicly\nTraded Value” of such equity securities shall be the Net\nProceeds from such sale; (C) “Net Proceeds” means the\nproceeds received by the selling entity from the applicable\nsale, net of commissions and reasonable expenses relating to\nsuch sale, any exercise or conversion price with respect to\nsecurities resulting from the exercise or conversion of\ncontingent securities, and any applicable taxes of the selling\nentity (or if the selling entity is a pass-through entity for\nincome tax purposes, such entity’s owners), which shall be\ndetermined using a tax rate equivalent to the highest\nmarginal combined federal, state and local tax rate that\nwould be applicable in the locale where the principal place\nof business of the selling entity is located, which in the case\nof a Team or a Related Party of a Team shall be deemed to\nbe the locale of the arena in which the Team plays more than\none-half of its Regular Season home games; and (D) a sale\nof equity securities shall not be subject to inclusion in BRI if\nthe sale is part of a larger transaction in which (x) BRI has\nbeen fully accounted for or (y) all or substantially all of the\nassets of an NBA-related entity or business unit thereof are\nsold and such equity securities do not represent a majority\nof the value in such transaction. In all cases, the Publicly\nArticle VII\n163\nTraded Value of, Net Proceeds from, or Specifically\nAssigned Value of the applicable equity securities will be\nincluded in BRI over a five (5) year amortization period\n(inclusive of the Salary Cap Year in which such Publicly\nTraded or Specifically Assigned Value is first included in\nBRI), even if such equity securities are sold during such\nfive (5) year period.\n(iii)\nFor the avoidance of doubt, (A) in no event shall the value\nof, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in\nNBA-related entities be included in BRI, and (B) the value\nof, or proceeds or distributions from, equity securities in\nnon-NBA-related entities shall be included in BRI\nexclusively pursuant to this Section 1(a)(13), and only once\nunder the applicable provision of Section 1(a)(13)(i) above.\n(14) International Development and Operations Expenses. The NBA and\nLeague-related entities may deduct from BRI expenses related to the\ndevelopment and operation of the League’s international business\n(“Newly-Deductible International Expenses”), subject to a limit of\nten percent (10%) of the League’s gross BRI international revenues\n(the allowed amount of such expense following application of the\nten percent (10%) cap being the “Allowed Newly-Deductible\nInternational Expenses”).\nNewly-Deductible International\nExpenses for any Salary Cap Year shall include all such international\nexpenses incurred at the League level that are not otherwise\ndeductible under this Agreement (excluding expenses in\ncurrently-deductible categories that are in excess of applicable\npercentage-of-revenue expense caps and the write-down of equity\ninvestments). For the purposes of this Agreement, the League’s\ngross BRI international revenue and Newly-Deductible\nInternational Expenses for the 2021-22 Salary Cap Year were the\namounts set forth in the parties’ letter agreement dated\nJune 28, 2023.\n(15) Miscellaneous BRI Accounting Rules.\n(i)\nTeam charter travel expenses for Regular Season games,\nassociated with broadcast and other personnel for whom\nsuch travel expenses are otherwise deductible (for example,\n164\nArticle VII\nwithout limitation on any other example, Team personnel\ntraveling in connection with the sale of Team sponsorships),\nshall be deductible at fifty percent (50%).\n(ii)\nBRI for premium seating, in respect of: (A) bunker, super,\nand party suites, (B) theatre boxes, loge boxes, and other\nsuch non-traditional premium seating inventory, and\n(C) traditional club seats, shall be calculated by using the\nparties’ previously-agreed upon methods, as reflected in the\nAudit Report for the 2015-16 Salary Cap Year.\n(iii)\nTo the extent salary paid to a person who also owns an\ninterest in the Team would otherwise be deductible from\nBRI, such salary shall only be deductible for BRI purposes\nonly if all of the following criteria are met and if the expense\notherwise qualifies for such deduction (for example, without\nlimitation, the salary is related to the BRI against which it is\ndeducted): (A) the owner owns less than seven and one-half\npercent (7.5%) of the Team; (B) the job being performed by\nthe owner would otherwise be performed by a non-owner\nstaff member; (C) the job being performed by the owner is\nhis/her full time job and he/she has no other roles with\noutside companies (with the exception of limited duty Board\nroles); (D) the salary being earned is reasonable and\ncustomary, relative to what a non-owner staff member\nwould earn, for the services being provided; and (E) there\nare no other individuals performing substantially the same\nrole employed by the Team where the role is such that\nordinarily there is only one person performing it (for\nexample, without limitation, Team president).\n(iv)\nWith respect to expenses associated with League-related\nentity advertising and public relations campaigns: (A) the\nexpenses will be allocated to BRI and non-BRI revenue\ncategories according to the methodology agreed to by the\nparties in connection with the final Audit Report for the\n2015-16 Salary Cap Year, except that such expenses shall\nalso be allocated to the NBA’s Regular Season gate\nassessment during the Salary Cap Year in addition to the\nother categories previously included in the allocation; and\nArticle VII\n165\n(B) the expenses shall be deducted from BRI, subject to\nSection 1(a)(6)(ii) above.\n(v)\nRevenues and expenses related to the new In-Season\nTournament (“IST”) shall be included in BRI as follows:\n(A) revenues and expenses from home-market Group Stage\ngames and IST Quarterfinals games not played in a neutral\nmarket will be treated as if earned or incurred during a\nRegular Season game; (B) notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in this Agreement, including, without limitation,\nArticle XX, Section 4(c), for purposes of Article VII,\nSection 1(a), revenues and expenses from neutral-market\ngames will be treated as league “Special Events,” subject to\nthe 100% expense cap for Special Events, except that, during\nthe 2023-24 and 2024-25 Salary Cap Years only, 50% of the\nexpenses related to any neutral-market IST game (other than\nthe IST Finals Game, and excluding any payments from the\nNBA to Teams described in the succeeding subpart) will be\ntreated as Team expenses subject to Section (1)(a)(6)(v)\nabove; and (C) payments from the NBA to Teams for\nparticipation in neutral-market IST games will be included in\nmiscellaneous BRI at the Team level, with the NBA\nrecording an expense relating to such payment at the League\nlevel in Special Events.\n(vi)\nBarter otherwise includable in BRI will not be excluded\nsolely on the basis that the bartered-for goods or services\nwere not used. For the avoidance of doubt, expenses\nassociated with the receipt and use of bartered goods or\nservices will be deductible from BRI subject to rules\napplicable to other expenses (e.g., that a barter expense is\ndeductible only where it relates to a category that allows for\ndeduction of expenses).\n(b) Accounting Methods/Lump Sum Payments.\n(1) Subject to Sections 1(b)(2) and (b)(3) below, and any provision\nhereof that expressly provides for an alternative accounting\ntreatment, BRI for each Salary Cap Year shall be calculated\nexclusively pursuant to the accrual method of financial accounting\n166\nArticle VII\n(and not, for any purpose, the cash method of financial accounting)\nand in accordance with United States Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles. By way of example, and not limitation, in\nthe event a team receives a signing bonus in consideration for its\nagreement to enter into a five (5) year contract for the local telecast\nof its games, such signing bonus shall be amortized in equal annual\namounts over the five (5) Salary Cap Years covered by such\ntelevision contract.\n(2) Except as otherwise provided in the case of luxury suites and\npremium seat licenses, in no event shall the amortization period for\nany lump sum payment exceed seven (7) years.\n(3) Any payments that constitute BRI and that are subject to being\nrepaid to the payor under certain circumstances (the\n“Contingencies”) shall constitute BRI in the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich such payments would have been earned but for the\nContingencies unless, at the time of such payments, the\nContingencies under which the payments would be repaid are likely\nto occur, in which case the payments will not be included in BRI\nunless and until such time as the Contingencies under which such\nrepayments would be made do not occur or are not likely to occur.\nIn the event that a payment that has been included in BRI is\nsubsequently repaid, BRI shall be reduced by the amount of such\nrepayment in the Salary Cap Year in which such repayment is made.\nIn any proceeding commenced before the System Arbitrator relating\nto the terms of this Section 1(b)(3), the NBA will bear the burden of\ndemonstrating that the applicable Contingencies are likely to occur.\n(4) With respect to lump sum payments (e.g., signing bonuses) that\nconstitute BRI and are received by a Team or Related Party under\nagreements entered into by a Team or Related Party, for the period,\nif any, between (x) the date when the lump sum payment is received\nand (y) the beginning of the Salary Cap Year when the amortization\nperiod for the lump sum payment begins pursuant to Section 1(b)(1)\nabove, BRI shall include in each applicable Salary Cap Year during\nthis period imputed interest on the amount of such lump sum\npayment at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as\npublished in The Wall Street Journal on the date the payment was\nreceived; provided, however, that such imputed interest shall only\nArticle VII\n167\nbe calculated and included in BRI if each of the following is satisfied:\n(i) the lump sum payment received by the Team or Related Party is\nin the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more; (ii) the\nlump sum payment is received by the Team or Related Party at least\ntwelve (12) months before the start of the Salary Cap Year in which\nit will first be included in BRI under Section 1(b)(1) above; and (iii)\nthe lump sum payment is not related to a ticket, luxury suite or seat\nlicensing transaction including, without limitation, revenues\nincluded in BRI under Sections 1(a)(1)(i), 1(a)(1)(vii), and 1(a)(1)(x)\nabove.\n(5) Loan proceeds from contractual counterparties that would be\nincluded in BRI if received as payment (rather than a loan) will be\nincluded in BRI if there is no realistic expectation of repayment,\nsubject to application of the lump sum amortization rules in this\nSection 1(b) and allocations for multi-element deals. If amounts in\nrespect of such a loan are included in BRI, but the loan is\nsubsequently repaid, BRI shall be reduced by the amount of such\nrepayment in the Salary Cap Year in which such repayment is made.\n(c) “Projected BRI” for a Salary Cap Year means the amount\ndetermined as follows: Prior to the start of each Salary Cap Year, the NBA\nand the Players Association shall meet for the purpose of agreeing upon\nProjected BRI for that Salary Cap Year. In the absence of an agreement of\nthe parties otherwise on or prior to the last day of the Moratorium Period\nof the applicable Salary Cap Year, Projected BRI for such Salary Cap Year\nshall be the sum of amounts determined in accordance with the following:\n(1) With respect to BRI sources other than national broadcast,\nnational telecast or network cable television contracts, Projected\nBRI shall include BRI for the preceding Salary Cap Year, increased\nby four and one-half percent (4.5%). For purposes of this\nSection 1(c)(1), a contract between or among any League-related\nentities and/or Teams shall not be considered national broadcast,\nnational telecast or network cable television contracts.\n(2) With respect to national broadcast, national telecast or network\ncable television contracts including the NBA/ABC agreement dated\nOctober 3, 2014 (“NBA/ABC Agreement”) (a copy of which has\nbeen provided to the Players Association) and the NBA/TBS\n168\nArticle VII\nagreement, dated October 3, 2014 (“NBA/TBS Agreement”) (a\ncopy of which has been provided to the Players Association), and\nnational broadcast, national telecast or network cable television\ncontracts covering Seasons that succeed the Seasons covered by the\nNBA/ABC and NBA/TBS Agreements (“Successor Agreements”)\n(copies of which shall be provided to the Players Association within\nten (10) days of execution), Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year shall\ninclude (i) the rights fees or other non-contingent payments stated\nin such contracts with respect to the Season covered by such Salary\nCap Year (as such rights fees or non-contingent payments may be\nadjusted by agreement of the parties to such contracts); (ii) the\namounts of revenue sharing proceeds, if any, that are includable in\nBRI for such Salary Cap Year pursuant to Section 1(a)(8) above;\n(iii) the amounts with respect to contingent payments (other than\nrevenue sharing proceeds), if any, attributable to Salary Cap Years\ncovered by this Agreement in Successor Agreements as such\namounts are agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties do not reach\nagreement, by the Accountants; and (iv) the amount included in BRI\nfor the preceding Salary Cap Year with respect to the value of\nadvertising or promotional time provided to the NBA as part of the\nNBA/ABC and NBA/TBS Agreements (or any Successor\nAgreements) that is used for any purpose other than those listed in\nSections 1(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(D).\n(3) In no event shall the same amounts be included in Projected\nBRI or Interim Projected BRI, directly or indirectly, more than once\n(including in the event that the terms of any Successor Agreements\nwould cause the same amounts to be indirectly included in Projected\nBRI or Interim Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year pursuant to\nboth subsections (1) and (2) above), the purpose of this provision\nbeing to preclude the double-counting of amounts in the calculation\nof Projected BRI or Interim Projected BRI, whether in the same or\nin multiple Salary Cap Years.\n(d) “Local Expansion Team BRI” means the BRI of the Expansion\nTeams during their first two (2) Seasons, but not including the Expansion\nTeams’ share of League-wide revenues that are otherwise included in BRI\n(including, but not limited to, their share of national television, cable, radio\nand other broadcast revenues).\nArticle VII\n169\n(e) “Projected Local Expansion Team BRI” means Local Expansion\nTeam BRI for the immediately preceding Season, increased by four and\none-half percent (4.5%).\n(f) “Interim Projected BRI” means a projection of BRI for a Salary Cap\nYear using Estimated BRI in place of BRI for the previous Salary Cap Year.\n(g) “Barter” means to trade by exchanging one commodity, service or\nother non-cash item for another.\n(h) “Estimated Total Benefits” means the estimate of Total Benefits for\na Salary Cap Year as set forth in the Interim Audit Report (as defined in\nSection 10(a) below) for such Salary Cap Year.\n(i) “Estimated Total Salaries” means the estimate of Total Salaries for\na Salary Cap Year as set forth in the Interim Audit Report for such Salary\nCap Year.\n(j) “Estimated Total Salaries and Benefits” means the sum of Estimated\nTotal Benefits and Estimated Total Salaries for a Salary Cap Year as set forth\nin the Interim Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.\n(k) “Estimated BRI” means the estimate of BRI for a Salary Cap Year\nas set forth in the Interim Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year."

The result of this calculation is the amount\nof the reduction in each of the Salary Cap,\nMinimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron\nLevel, and Second Apron Level for such\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further steps\nare required.\nIf Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap\nYear exceeds one hundred eight percent (108%) of\nBRI for the Salary Cap Year and the Overage\nAmount described above does not exceed nine\npercent (9%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then\nproceed to Step 3.\nSTEP 3: Subtract one hundred eight percent (108%) of BRI\nfor the Salary Cap Year from Projected BRI for the\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year.\nSTEP 4: Multiply the result of Step 3 by fifty percent (50%).\nSTEP 5: Subtract the result of Step 4 from the result of\nStep 1.

For the purposes of this Section 2(c)(5), MTS Cap Hold\nTeam Salaries shall:\n(i)\ninclude any Incentive Compensation excluded from Salaries\nin accordance with Article VII, Section 3(d) but actually\nearned by players during such Salary Cap Year; and\n(ii)\nexclude all Incentive Compensation included in Salaries in\naccordance with Article VII, Section 3(d) but not actually\nearned by players during such Salary Cap Year.\n(6) Any payment due by a Team in respect of a Salary Cap Year\npursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(i) or 2(c)(5) above shall be made by the\nTeam to the NBA no later than ten (10) business days following the\ncompletion of the Governing Audit Report for such Salary Cap\nYear. The NBA shall then distribute any such payments equally to\nArticle VII\n179\neach Team within ten (10) business days following its receipt of such\npayments.\n(7) Notwithstanding Section 2(c)(2)(ii) above, for the 2023-24\nSalary Cap Year only, if (i) a Team’s MTS Payment Team Salary for\nthe 2023-24 Salary Cap Year is less than the Minimum Team Salary\nfor such Salary Cap Year, and (ii) such Team does not owe a Tax for\nsuch Salary Cap Year, then such Team shall be entitled to receive a\nfifty percent (50%) share of any tax amount that the NBA elects to\ndistribute to non-taxpaying Teams in respect of such Salary Cap\nYear pursuant to Section 2(d)(4)(i) below. For example, if there were\ntwenty-four (24) non-taxpaying Teams for the 2023-24 Salary Cap\nYear and one (1) of such Teams had a MTS Payment Team Salary\nfor such Salary Cap Year less than the Minimum Team Salary, then\nsuch Team, rather than receiving one-twenty-fourth (1/24th) of the\ntotal amount that the NBA elects to distribute to non-taxpaying\nTeams pursuant to Section 2(d)(4)(i) below, would instead receive a\nTax distribution amount equal to the total amount to be distributed\nto non-taxpaying Teams multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is one-half (0.5) and the denominator of which is twenty-three\nand one-half (0.5/23.5). Each of the other twenty-three (23)\nnon-taxpaying Teams for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year would receive\na Tax distribution amount equal to the total amount to be distributed\nto non-taxpaying Teams multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is one (1) and the denominator of which is twenty-three and\none-half (1/23.5).\n(8) Nothing contained herein shall preclude a Team from having a\nTeam Salary in excess of the Minimum Team Salary, provided that\nthe Team’s Team Salary does not exceed the Salary Cap plus any\nadditional amounts authorized pursuant to the Exceptions set forth\nin this Article VII.\n(d) Operation of Tax Level.\n(1) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the\nfollowing meanings:\n(i)\n“Tax Team Salary” means, for a Team for a Salary Cap Year,\nthe Team’s Team Salary as of the start of its last Regular\n180\nArticle VII\nSeason game occurring within such Salary Cap Year,\ncalculated by the Accountants in the same manner as Team\nSalary is calculated by the Accountants for purposes of\ncomputing Total Salaries and Benefits in the Audit Report:\n(A)\nplus all Incentive Compensation excluded from\nSalary under Section 3(d) below but actually earned\nby the player during such Salary Cap Year;\n(B)\nminus all Incentive Compensation included in Salary\nunder Section 3(d) below but not actually earned by\nthe player during such Salary Cap Year;\n(C)\nplus, with respect to any trade that occurs following\nthe conclusion of the Team’s last Regular Season\ngame, the portion of any trade bonus earned by a\nplayer that is included in the Team’s Team Salary for\nsuch Salary Cap Year;\n(D)\nplus any amount that is added to the Team’s Team\nSalary for such Salary Cap Year following the start\nof the Team’s last Regular Season game pursuant to\nSection 4(a)(1)(iii) below;\n(E)\nminus fifty percent (50%) of any reduction made to\na player’s Compensation as a result of a suspension\nby the NBA (but not by a Team); and\n(F)\nplus, with respect to a Standard NBA Contract\nbetween a Team and a Free Agent with zero (0)\nYears of Service or one (1) Year of Service, the\namount (if any) by which (x) the Minimum Player\nSalary that would be applicable to a player with two\n(2) Years of Service as set forth in the Minimum\nAnnual Salary Scale for the Salary Cap Year in which\nsuch Free Agent was signed (or in the event such\nFree Agent’s Contract is terminated during the\nRegular Season, the Minimum Player Salary that\nwould be applicable to a player with two (2) Years of\nService as set forth in the Minimum Annual Salary\nArticle VII\n181\nScale for the Salary Cap Year in which such Free\nAgent was signed, reduced pro rata to reflect the\nplayer’s post-termination Salary), exceeds (y) the\nSalary attributable to such Standard NBA Contract.\nFor the purposes of this Section 2(d)(1)(i)(F):\n(ii)\n(1)\na Standard NBA Contract between a Team\nand a Two-Way Player (either signed\npursuant to Article II, Section 11(h), or the\nresult of the exercise of a Standard NBA\nContract Conversion Option) will be\ndeemed to be a “Standard NBA Contract\nbetween a Team and a Free Agent” provided\nthat such Two-Way Player’s Two-Way\nContract was: (i) signed by the player as a\nFree Agent; or (ii) the result of the exercise\nof the Two-Way Player Conversion Option\nprovided for in the Exhibit 10 of a Contract\nthat he signed as a Free Agent; and\n(2)\na Standard NBA Contract between a Team\nand a player under a 10-Day Contract\n(signed pursuant to Article II, Section 9(g))\nwill be deemed to be a Standard NBA\nContract between a Team and a Free Agent\nprovided that such 10-Day Contract was\nsigned by the player as a Free Agent.\n“Tax Bracket Amount” means, for a Salary Cap Year, an\namount equal to $5 million multiplied by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the Salary Cap for such Salary Cap\nYear and the denominator of which is the Salary Cap for the\n2023-24 Salary Cap Year.\nFor example, assume the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap\nYear is $134 million and the Salary Cap for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear is $140.7 million. The Tax Bracket Amount for the 2023-24\nSalary Cap Year would be $5 million (i.e., $5 million multiplied by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is $134 million and the denominator\nof which is $134 million), and the Tax Bracket Amount for the\n182\nArticle VII\n2024-25 Salary Cap Year would be $5.25 million (i.e., $5 million\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is $140.7 million (the\n2024-25 Salary Cap) and the denominator of which is $134 million\n(the 2023-24 Salary Cap)).\n(2) Each Team whose Tax Team Salary exceeds the Tax Level for\nany Salary Cap Year shall be required to pay a tax to the NBA. For\neach Salary Cap Year, the tax shall be calculated: (A) using the\napplicable rates in Section 2(d)(2)(i) (“Standard Tax Rates”) for any\nTeam whose Tax Team Salary did not exceed the Tax Level in three\n(3) or more of the four (4) Salary Cap Years immediately preceding\nsuch Salary Cap Year; and (B) using the applicable rates shown in\nSection 2(d)(2)(ii) (“Repeater Tax Rates”) for any Team whose Tax\nTeam Salary exceeded the Tax Level in three (3) or more of the four\n(4) Salary Cap Years immediately preceding such Salary Cap Year.\nArticle VII\n(i)\n183\nStandard Tax Rates:\nTax Rate for Increment\nIncremental Team\nSalary Above\nTax Level\n$0 – 100% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n100% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nand Over\n2023-24 and 2024-25\nSalary Cap Years\nBeginning with\n2025-26 Salary Cap\nYear\n$1.50-for-$1\n$1.00-for-$1\n$1.75-for-$1\n$1.25-for-$1\n$2.50-for-$1\n$3.50-for-$1\n$3.25-for-$1\n$4.75-for-$1\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$3.75-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$5.25-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\n184\nArticle VII\n(ii)\nRepeater Tax Rates:\nTax Rate for Increment\nIncremental Team\nSalary Above\nTax Level\n$0 – 100% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n100% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nand Over\n2023-24 and 2024-25\nSalary Cap Years\nBeginning with\n2025-26 Salary Cap\nYear\n$2.50-for-$1\n$3.00-for-$1\n$2.75-for-$1\n$3.25-for-$1\n$3.50-for-$1\n$5.50-for-$1\n$4.25-for-$1\n$6.75-for-$1\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$4.75-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$7.25-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\nExample: In respect of the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, the Tax\nBracket Amount is $5 million.

(Note, for clarity, that it is\nnecessarily the case that Team C also did not engage in the transaction set\nforth in row G of the Transactions Restriction Table at any point from the\nday following the last day of the 2024-25 Regular Season through the date\nof the Player Contract signing in this example, because such transaction can\noccur only during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year.)

Such trade (a\ntransaction set forth in row G of the Transaction Restrictions Table with\nan Applicable Apron Level of the First Apron Level): (a) is not prohibited\nby Section 2(e)(2)(i)(B) above because Team E had not previously engaged\nin any of the transactions set forth in rows A through E of the Transaction\nRestrictions Table at any point during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year (i.e.,\ntransactions that would have prohibited Team E from having an Apron\nTeam Salary that exceeds the First Apron Level in the 2023-24 Salary\nCap Year); (b) is not prohibited by Section 2(e)(2)(i)(A) above because,\nnotwithstanding that Team E’s 2023-24 Apron Team Salary exceeds\n$170 million (i.e., the 2023-24 First Apron Level), pursuant to\nSection 2(e)(5) above, a Team that uses the Transition Traded Player\nException to acquire a player during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year will\nnot by virtue of using such Traded Player Exception be prohibited from\nhaving a 2023-24 Apron Team Salary that exceeds the 2023-24 First\nApron Level; and (c) is not prohibited by Section 2(e)(2)(ii)(A) above\nbecause, immediately following such trade, Team E’s 2024-25 Apron\nTeam Salary (calculated in accordance with Section 2(e)(3)(i) above) is less\nthan or equal to $170 million (i.e., the assumed 2024-25 First Apron\nLevel as calculated in accordance with Section 2(e)(3)(ii) above).

For example, if Team A’s and Team\nB’s first round draft picks in the 2032 NBA Draft are each\nsubject to a Draft Pick Penalty, and Team A finished with a\nbetter winning percentage than Team B for the 2031-32\nRegular Season, then Team A would make the final selection\nin the first round of the 2032 NBA Draft and Team B would\nmake the immediately preceding selection.\n(2) Beginning with the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year, if a Team is a\nSecond Apron Team for a Salary Cap Year, then:\n(i)\nthe Team shall be prohibited from trading (either\nconditionally or unconditionally) its first round draft pick in\nthe first NBA Draft that occurs following the seventh\nSeason that follows the Season occurring within such Salary\nCap Year; and\n(ii)\nwith respect to the four (4) Salary Cap Years immediately\nfollowing such Salary Cap Year:\n(A)\nIf the Team is a Second Apron Team for two (2) or\nmore of such four (4) Salary Cap Years, then such\nfirst round draft pick shall be subject to a Draft Pick\nPenalty; and\nArticle VII\n(B)\n197\nIf the Team is a Second Apron Team for fewer than\ntwo (2) of such four (4) Salary Cap Years, then, as of\nthe day following the last day of the Regular Season\nencompassed by the third of such four (4) Salary Cap\nYears in which the Team is not a Second Apron\nTeam, such Team shall be permitted to trade\n(conditionally or unconditionally) such first round\ndraft pick. For clarity, such first round draft pick\nshall not be subject to a Draft Pick Penalty.\nExample: If Team A is a Second Apron Team for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear, then it would be prohibited from trading its 2032 first round draft pick\n(i.e., its first round draft pick in the first NBA Draft that occurs following the\nseventh Season that follows the Season occurring within such Salary Cap Year).\nIf Team A is also a Second Apron Team for the 2025-26 and 2028-29 Salary\nCap Years, then Team A’s 2032 first round draft pick would be subject to a\nDraft Pick Penalty.\nExample: If Team B is a Second Apron Team for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear, then it would be prohibited from trading its 2032 first round draft pick.\nIf Team B is not a Second Apron Team in the 2025-26, 2026-27, and\n2027-28 Salary Cap Years, then Team B would be permitted to trade its 2032\nfirst round draft pick as of the day following the last day of the 2027-28 Regular\nSeason (and such first round draft pick would not be subject to a Draft Pick\nPenalty).\n(g) Expansion Team Salary Caps, Minimum Team Salaries, Tax\nLevels, and Apron Levels. Each Expansion Team shall have the same\nSalary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron Level, and\nSecond Apron Level as all other Teams, except as follows:\n(1) During the first Salary Cap Year in which it begins play, an\nExpansion Team shall have a Salary Cap equal to sixty-six and\ntwo-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the Salary Cap calculated pursuant\nto Section 2(a) above (the “First Year Expansion Team Salary Cap”);\nand shall have a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety percent\n(90%) of the First Year Expansion Team Salary Cap.\n(2) During the Salary Cap Year immediately following the Salary\nCap Year in which it begins play, an Expansion Team shall have a\n198\nArticle VII\nSalary Cap equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Salary Cap calculated\npursuant to Section 2(a) above (the “Second Year Expansion Team\nSalary Cap”); and shall have a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety\npercent (90%) of the Second Year Expansion Team Salary Cap."

For purposes of this\nSection 3(a)(2)(iv), a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent who\n(x) enters into an Over 38 Contract with his Prior Team\nprior to October 1 of a Salary Cap Year, (y) is age 34 at the\ntime he enters into the Contract, and (z) will turn age 35 on\nor before such October 1 shall be deemed to be 35 at the\ntime he enters into such Over 38 Contract.\n(v)\nFor purposes of determining whether a Contract is an\nOver 38 Contract pursuant to this Section 3(a)(2) only,\nSeasons shall be deemed to commence on October 1 and\nconclude on the last day of the Salary Cap Year.\n(vi)\n“Zero Year” means, with respect to an Over 38 Contract,\nany Salary Cap Year in which the Salary called for under the\nContract has been attributed, in accordance with\nSection 3(a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) above, to prior Salary Cap Years\nof the Contract. “First Zero Year” means, with respect to\n200\nArticle VII\nan Over 38 Contract, the earliest Salary Cap Year in which\nthe Salary called for under the Contract has been attributed,\nin accordance with Section 3(a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) above, to\nprior Salary Cap Years of the Contract.\n(vii)\nFor purposes of this subsection (a)(2): (i) a player (A) whose\nbirthday is on a date during the Moratorium Period and\n(B) who signs a Contract, Extension, or Renegotiation on or\nbefore the fifth day following the date on which the\nMoratorium Period concludes shall be treated as if his age,\nat the time of such signing, was his age on the immediately\npreceding June 30; and (ii) any player whose Over 38\nContract is signed pursuant to Section 8(e)(1) below shall not\nbe considered a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent.\n(b) Signing Bonuses.\n(1) Amounts Treated as Signing Bonuses: For purposes of determining\na player’s Salary, the term “signing bonus” shall include:\n(i)\nany amount provided for in a Player Contract that is earned\nupon the signing of such Contract;\n(ii)\nat the time of a trade of a Player Contract, any amount that,\nunder the terms of the Contract, is earned in the form of a\nbonus upon the trade of the Contract; and\n(iii)\npayments in excess of the Excluded International Player\nPayment Amount, in accordance with Section 3(e) below.\n(2) Proration: Any signing bonus contained in a Player Contract\nshall be allocated over the number of Salary Cap Years (or over the\nthen-current and any remaining Salary Cap Years in the case of a\nsigning bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above) covered by\nsuch Contract in proportion to the percentage of Base\nCompensation in each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of\nallocation, is protected for lack of skill; provided, however, that if\nthe Player Contract provides for an ETO, the foregoing allocation\nshall be performed only over Salary Cap Years that precede the\nEffective Season of such ETO. In the event that, at the time of\nallocation, none of the Base Compensation provided for by a Player\nArticle VII\n201\nContract (or none of the then-current or remaining Base\nCompensation in the case of a signing bonus described in\nSection 3(b)(1)(ii) above) is protected for lack of skill, then the entire\namount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the first Salary Cap\nYear of the Contract (or, in the case of a signing bonus described in\nSection 3(b)(1)(ii) above, the Salary Cap Year during which the\nplayer’s Contract is traded).\n(3) Extensions:\n(i)\nIn the event that a Team with a Team Salary at or over the\nSalary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or contains\na signing bonus, such signing bonus shall be paid no sooner\nthan the first day of the first Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term and shall be allocated, in equal parts, over the\nnumber of Salary Cap Years covered by the extended term\nin proportion to the percentage of Base Compensation in\neach such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of allocation, is\nprotected for lack of skill. In the event that, at the time of\nthe allocation, none of the Base Compensation provided for\nduring the extended term is protected for lack of skill, then\nthe entire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to\nthe first Salary Cap Year of the extended term.\n(ii)\nA Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may enter\ninto an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus\nto be paid at any time during the Contract’s original or\nextended term. In the event that a Team with a Team Salary\nbelow the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for\nor contains a signing bonus to be paid no sooner than the\nfirst day of the Salary Cap Year covered by such extended\nterm, the bonus shall be allocated in accordance with the\nproration rules set forth in Section 3(b)(3)(i) above. In the\nevent a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap enters\ninto an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus\nto be paid prior to the first day of the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term, the following rules shall\napply:\n202\nArticle VII\n(A)\nThe signing bonus shall be allocated over the\nremaining Salary Cap Years (including the\nthen-current Salary Cap Year) under the original\nterm of the Contract and the extended term in\nproportion to the percentage of Base Compensation\nin each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of\nallocation, is protected for lack of skill. In the event\nthat, at the time of allocation, none of the Base\nCompensation provided for during the then-current\nand any remaining Salary Cap Years under the\noriginal term of the Contract or during the extended\nterm is protected for lack of skill, then the entire\namount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the\nSalary Cap Year during which the Extension is\nsigned; and\n(B)\nThe Extension shall be deemed a Renegotiation and\nshall be subject to the rules governing\nRenegotiations set forth in Section 7 below; and\n(C)\nNotwithstanding Article II, Section 3(b), the\nExhibit 1 of such Extension must provide that the\nsigning bonus shall be paid in two (2) installments as\nfollows:\n(1)\nthe first installment shall be paid on a\nspecified date prior to the first day of the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term, and shall be for an amount\nequal to the portion of the signing bonus\nthat is allocated to the Salary Cap Year(s)\ncovered by the original term of the Contract;\nand\n(2)\nthe second installment shall be paid on a\nspecified date on or after the first day of the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term, and shall be for an amount\nequal to the portion of the signing bonus\nthat is allocated to the Salary Cap Year(s)\nArticle VII\n203\ncovered by the extended term of the\nContract.\n(iii)\nIf a Team and player enter into an Extension and provide\nthat the trade bonus provision contained in the original\nContract would not be applicable to the extended term in\naccordance with Article XXIV, Section 2(a)(v), then, in the\ncase of an earned signing bonus described in\nSection 3(b)(1)(ii) above, the signing bonus shall be allocated\nover the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Year(s)\ncovered by the original term of the extended Contract (and\nnot any of the Salary Cap Years covered by the extended\nterm) in proportion to the percentage of Base Compensation\nin each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of allocation,\nis protected for lack of skill. In the event that, at the time of\nallocation, none of the then-current or applicable remaining\nBase Compensation is protected for lack of skill, then the\nentire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the\nSalary Cap Year during which the player’s extended Contract\nis traded.\n(iv)\nIf a Team and player enter into an Extension that contains a\ntrade bonus provision that is applicable to the Contract’s\noriginal and extended term, then, in the case of a signing\nbonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above that is earned\nprior to the first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term:\n(A)\nFor purposes of calculating the signing bonus and\nallocating the signing bonus to the applicable Salary\nCap Year(s), the Base Compensation in the extended\nterm of the Contract shall be the Base\nCompensation as set forth in the Contract; provided,\nhowever, that:\n(1)\nIf the Contract provides for Base\nCompensation in the first Salary Cap Year of\nthe extended term that is expressed as a\npercentage of the Salary Cap in accordance\nwith Article II, Section 7(d) or Section 7(e),\n204\nArticle VII\nthen the Base Compensation in the extended\nterm of the Contract shall be determined\nassuming that the Salary Cap will increase by\nfour and one-half percent (4.5%) each Salary\nCap Year beginning with the Salary Cap Year\nfollowing the then-current Salary Cap Year\nand ending with the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term; or\n(2)\n(B)\nIf the Contract provides for Salary plus\nUnlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year\nof the extended term that exceeds the\napplicable Maximum Annual Salary that\nwould apply to such player assuming that\n(a) the player will be credited with a Year of\nService for each remaining year of the\noriginal term of the Contract, and (b) the\nSalary Cap will increase by four and one-half\npercent (4.5%) each Salary Cap Year\nbeginning with the Salary Cap Year\nfollowing the then-current Salary Cap Year\nand ending with the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term, then the Base\nCompensation in the extended term of the\nContract shall be determined to be the Base\nCompensation that would result from the\ndeemed amendment(s) pursuant to\nArticle II, Section 7(c) using the\nassumptions described in clauses (a) and (b)\nof this subsection.\nNotwithstanding the Exhibit 4 to such Contract, the\nsigning bonus shall be paid in two (2) installments as\nfollows:\n(1)\nThe first installment shall be paid within\nthirty (30) days of the date of the trade to\nwhich the bonus applies, and shall be for an\namount equal to the portion of the signing\nbonus that is allocated to the Salary Cap\nArticle VII\n205\nYear(s) covered by the original term of the\nContract; and\n(2)\n(v)\nThe second installment shall be paid within\nthirty (30) days of the first day of the first\nSalary Cap Year covered by the extended\nterm, and shall be for an amount equal to the\nportion of the signing bonus that is allocated\nto the Salary Cap Year(s) covered by the\nextended term of the Contract.\nIn the event that a team is required to make signing bonus\npayment(s) pursuant to Section 3(b)(3)(i), 3(b)(3)(ii)(C), or\n3(b)(3)(iv) above, and the amount(s) of the signing bonus\nallocation in respect of such signing bonus are deemed\namended pursuant to Article II, Section 7(c), then the\namount of the payment required pursuant to\nSection 3(b)(3)(i), 3(b)(3)(ii)(C)(2), or 3(b)(3)(iv)(B)(2) above\nshall be reduced to equal the sum of the signing bonus\nallocation amount(s) that result from the deemed\namendment(s) pursuant to Article II, Section 7(c).\n(c) Loans to Players. The following rules shall apply to any loan made\nby any Team to a player:\n(1) If any such loan bears no interest (or annual interest at an\neffective rate lower than the “Target Rate” (as defined below)), then\nthe interest shall be imputed on the outstanding balance at a rate\nequal to the difference between the Target Rate and the actual rate\nof interest to be paid by the player and such imputed interest shall\nbe included in the player’s Salary. The “Target Rate” means the\n“Prime Rate” (as defined below) plus one percent (1%) as of the\ndate the loan is agreed upon, except that the “Target Rate” shall be\nno lower than seven percent (7%) or greater than nine percent (9%).\nFor purposes of this Section 3(c)(1), “Prime Rate” means the prime\nrate reported in the “Money Rates” column or any successor column\nof The Wall Street Journal.\n(2) No loan made to a player may (along with other outstanding\nloans to the player) exceed the amount of the player’s Salary for the\n206\nArticle VII\nthen-current Salary Cap Year that is protected for lack of skill. All\nloans must be repaid through deductions from the player’s\nremaining Current Base Compensation over the years of the\nContract that, at the time the loan is agreed upon, provide for Base\nCompensation that is fully protected for lack of skill (prior to the\nEffective Season of any ETO) in equal annual amounts (the “annual\nallocable repayment amounts”). If a loan is made at a time when the\nremaining Current Base Compensation due for the relevant Season\nthat is fully protected for lack of skill is less than the annual allocable\nrepayment amount that would be owed on a loan for the full amount\nof the player’s Current Base Compensation that is fully protected for\nlack of skill for the relevant Season (the “maximum annual allocable\nrepayment amount”), the maximum loan amount for that Season\nshall be reduced by the amount by which the maximum annual\nallocable repayment amount exceeds the amount of remaining\nCurrent Base Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill.\n(For example, if a Player has $2 million in Current Base\nCompensation (fully protected for lack of skill) in the first Season of\na five-year Contract, and a loan is made during that Season at a time\nwhen the Player has already received his Current Base\nCompensation for that Season, the loan may not exceed\n$1.6 million.)\n(3) In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 3(c)(2) above:\n(i) no loan may be made that would result in a violation of Article II,\nSection 13(e); and (ii) no loan may be made to a player whose\nContract provides for Base Compensation equal to the Minimum\nPlayer Salary.\n(4) Any forgiveness by a Team of a loan to a player shall be deemed\na Renegotiation in the Salary Cap Year of such forgiveness and shall\nbe subject to the rules governing Renegotiations set forth in\nSection 7 below.\n(d) Incentive Compensation.\n(1) For purposes of determining a player’s Salary each Salary Cap\nYear, except as provided in Sections 3(d)(2)-(4) below, any\nPerformance Bonus (provided such Performance Bonus may be\nincluded in a Player Contract in accordance with Section 5(b) below),\nArticle VII\n207\nshall be included in Salary only if such Performance Bonus would\nbe earned if the Team’s or player’s performance were identical to the\nperformance in the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year.\n(2) Notwithstanding Section 3(d)(1) above, in the event that, at the\ntime of the signing of a Contract, Renegotiation or Extension, the\nNBA or the Players Association believes that the performance of a\nplayer and/or his Team during the immediately preceding Salary Cap\nYear does not fairly predict the likelihood of the player earning a\nPerformance Bonus during any Salary Cap Year covered by the\nContract, Renegotiation, or extended term of the Extension (as the\ncase may be), the NBA or the Players Association may request that\na jointly selected basketball expert (“Expert”) determine whether\n(i) in the case of an NBA challenge, it is more likely than not that\nthe bonus will be earned, or (ii) in the case of a Players Association\nchallenge, it is very likely that the bonus will not be earned. The\nparty initiating a proceeding before the Expert shall carry the burden\nof proof. The Expert shall conduct a hearing within five (5) business\ndays after the initiation of the proceeding, and shall render a\ndetermination within five (5) business days after the hearing.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(d)(2), no\nparty may, in connection with any proceeding before the Expert,\nrefer to the facts that, absent a challenge pursuant to this\nSection 3(d)(2), a Performance Bonus would or would not be\nincluded in a player’s Salary pursuant to Section 3(d)(1) above, or\nwould be termed “Likely” or “Unlikely” pursuant to Article I,\nSection 1(ff) or (eeee). If, following an NBA challenge, the Expert\ndetermines that a Performance Bonus is more likely than not to be\nearned, the bonus shall be included in the player’s Salary. If,\nfollowing a Players Association challenge, the Expert determines\nthat a Performance Bonus is very likely not to be earned, the bonus\nshall be excluded from the player’s Salary. The Expert’s\ndetermination that a Performance Bonus is more likely than not to\nbe earned or very likely not to be earned shall be final, binding and\nunappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection with\nany proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 3(d)(2) shall be\nborne equally by the parties.\n(3) In the case of a Rookie or a Veteran who did not play during\nthe immediately preceding Salary Cap Year who signs a Contract\n208\nArticle VII\ncontaining a Performance Bonus, or in the case of a player signed or\nacquired by an Expansion Team whose Contract contains a\nPerformance Bonus to be paid as a result of, in whole or in part, the\nplayer’s achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to the\nTeam’s performance during its first Salary Cap Year, such\nPerformance Bonus will be included in Salary if it is likely to be\nearned. In the event that the NBA and the Players Association\ncannot agree as to whether a Performance Bonus is likely to be\nearned, such dispute will be referred to the Expert, who will\ndetermine whether the bonus is likely to be earned or not likely to\nbe earned. The Expert shall conduct a hearing within five (5)\nbusiness days after the initiation of the proceeding, and shall render\na determination within five (5) business days after the hearing. The\nExpert’s determination that a Performance Bonus is likely to be\nearned or not likely to be earned shall be final, binding, and\nunappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection with\nany proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 3(d)(3) shall be\nborne equally by the parties.\n(4) In the event that either party initiates a proceeding pursuant to\nSection 3(d)(2) or (3) above, the player’s Salary plus the full amount\nof any disputed bonuses shall be included in Team Salary during the\npendency of the proceeding.\n(5) In the event the NBA and the Players Association cannot agree\non an Expert, any challenge pursuant to Sections 3(d)(2) and (3)\nabove may be filed with the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with\nArticle XXXI, Sections 2-7 and 15.\n(6) All Incentive Compensation described in Article II,\nSections 3(b)(iii) and 3(c) shall be included in Salary.\n(e) International Player Payments.\n(1) Any amount in excess of the amounts set forth below\n(“Excluded International Player Payment Amounts”) paid or to be\npaid by or at the direction of any NBA Team to (i) any basketball\nteam other than an NBA Team, or (ii) any other entity, organization,\nrepresentative or person, for the purpose of inducing a player who\nis participating in the game of basketball as a professional outside of\nArticle VII\n209\nthe United States to enter into a Player Contract or in connection\nwith securing the right to enter into a Player Contract with such a\nplayer shall be deemed Salary (in the form of a signing bonus) to the\nplayer:\nSalary Cap Year\n2023-24\n2024-25\n2025-26\n2026-27\n2027-28\n2028-29\n2029-30\nExcluded International Player\nPayment Amount\n$825,000\n$850,000\n$875,000\n$900,000\n$925,000\n$950,000\n$975,000\n(2) Subject to Article XIII, any payment up to the Excluded\nInternational Player Payment Amount for a Salary Cap Year paid by\nor at the direction of any NBA Team pursuant to Section 3(e)(1)\nabove to a professional basketball team outside the United States to\nsecure the contractual release of a player shall not be deemed Salary\nto the player.\n(3) Any payment for a Salary Cap Year paid by or at the direction\nof any NBA Team pursuant to Section 3(e)(1) above may be paid in\na single installment or in multiple installments. The Excluded\nInternational Player Payment Amount, whether used in whole or in\npart, may be used by an NBA Team whenever it signs a player to a\nnew Player Contract, except that the Excluded International Player\nPayment Amount may not be used, in whole or in part, more than\nonce in any three-Salary Cap Year period with respect to the same\nplayer.\n(4) The Excluded International Player Payment Amount, or any\npart of it, shall be deemed to have been used as of the date of the\nPlayer Contract to which it applies, regardless of when it is actually\npaid. A schedule of payments relating to the Excluded International\nPlayer Payment Amount, or any part of it, agreed upon at the time\nof the signing of the Player Contract to which it applies, shall not be\ndeemed a multiple use of the Excluded International Player Payment\nAmount.\n210\nArticle VII\n(5) Notwithstanding Section 3(e)(1) above, no amount paid or to\nbe paid pursuant to this Section 3(e) shall be counted toward the\nMinimum Team Salary obligation of a Team in accordance with\nSection 2(b) or (c) above.\n(6) Within two (2) business days following the NBA’s receipt of\nnotice of any payments made by any NBA Team that are governed\nby this Section 3(e), the NBA shall provide the Players Association\nwith written notice of such payments.\n(7) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(e),\nTeams shall be prohibited from making any payment governed by\nthis Section 3(e) for the purpose of inducing a player to enter into a\nTwo-Way Contract or a Contract with an Exhibit 10, or in\nconnection with securing the right to enter into a Two-Way Contract\nor a Contract with an Exhibit 10 with a player; and any Team that\nagrees to make a payment governed by this Section 3(e) with respect\nto a player shall be prohibited from entering into a Two-Way\nContract or a Contract with an Exhibit 10 with such player for a\nperiod of one (1) year following the date of such agreement.\n(f) One-Year Minimum Contracts. Except where otherwise stated\nin this Agreement, the Salary of every player who signs a one-year, 10-Day,\nor Rest-of-Season Contract for the Minimum Player Salary applicable to\nsuch player shall be the lesser of (1) such Minimum Player Salary, or (2) the\nportion of such Minimum Player Salary that is not reimbursed out of the\nLeague-wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section 6(h).\n(g) Insurance Premium Reimbursement. If a Team reimburses a\nplayer for life insurance premiums pursuant to Article II, Section 4(j)(ii),\nsuch premium reimbursement shall not be included in the computation of\nthe player’s Salary.\n(h) Averaging. In accordance with Article XI, Section 5(d)(iii), a\nplayer’s Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by his Contract shall be\ndeemed in certain circumstances to be the average of the aggregate Salaries\nfor each such Salary Cap Year.\n(i) Player Conduct-Related Compensation Reductions. The\ncomputation of a player’s Salary shall be made without regard to any\nArticle VII\n211\nreduction made (or to be made) to his Compensation in accordance with\nArticle VI, Section 1 or Article XLI, Section 4(e). For clarity, this\nSection 3(i) shall not apply to the computation of a player’s Adjustment\nSalary in accordance with Article VII, Section 12.\n(j) Existing Contracts. A player’s Salary with respect to any Salary\nCap Year covered by a Contract entered into prior to the effective date of\nthis Agreement shall continue to be calculated in accordance with the Salary\nCap rules that were in existence at the time the Contract was entered into\nexcept as provided in Section 7(d)(6) below. In no event shall the preceding\nsentence apply to the calculation of Salary with respect to any Contract,\nExtension (with respect to the extended term), Renegotiation, transaction,\nor event entered into or occurring on or after the effective date of this\nAgreement."

For purposes of computing Team Salary under this\nAgreement, all of the following amounts shall be included:\n(1) Subject to the rules set forth in this Article VII, the aggregate\nSalaries of all active players (and former players to the extent\nprovided by the terms of this Agreement) attributable to a particular\nSalary Cap Year, including, without limitation:\n(i)\nSalaries paid or to be paid to players whose Player Contracts\nhave been terminated pursuant to the NBA’s waiver\nprocedure (without regard to any revised payment schedule\nthat might be provided for in the terminated Player\nContracts), except that, with respect to any Player Contract\nthat has been terminated pursuant to the NBA’s waiver\nprocedure, if the waiving Team elects in writing to have the\nplayer’s Salary stretched for Team Salary purposes in\naccordance with applicable CBA stretch rules, then the\namount to be included in Team Salary for a Salary Cap Year\nin respect of the terminated Player Contract shall equal the\namount allocated to such Salary Cap Year in accordance with\nsuch rules.\n212\nArticle VII\n(ii)\nAny amount called for in a retired player’s Player Contract\npaid or to be paid to the player. When a player retires and\nthe Team continues to pay such amounts, then, for purposes\nof computing the player’s Salary for the then-current and any\nremaining Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract, the\naggregate of such amounts, notwithstanding the payment\nschedule, shall be allocated pro rata over the then-current\nand each remaining Salary Cap Year on the basis of the\nremaining unearned protected Compensation in each such\nSalary Cap Year at the time of retirement.\n(iii)\nAmounts paid or to be paid pursuant to awards for, or\nsettlements of, Grievances between a player and a Team\nconcerning Compensation obligations under a Player\nContract in accordance with the following rules (which,\nexcept for purposes of Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(C) below, shall be\napplied with respect to each Season for which there is any\nCompensation in dispute, as if the grievance relates only to\nsuch Season):\n(A)\n(1)\nWhen a player initiates a Grievance (as\ndefined in Article XXXI) against a Team\nseeking the payment of Compensation for a\nSeason covered by the current or any future\nSalary Cap Year that the Team asserts is not\nowed, fifty percent (50%) of the disputed\namount shall be included in Team Salary for\nthe Salary Cap Year to which the Grievance\nrelates.

In order to facilitate any such\n214\nArticle VII\nrequired tax refund from the NBA to the\nTeam, the NBA shall set aside, pending\nresolution of the Grievance, the amount of\ntax paid by that Team in the Salary Cap Year\nto which the Grievance relates that is\nattributable to the fifty percent (50%)\nallocation. Following resolution of the\nGrievance, the NBA shall pay to the Team\nthe tax refund to which it is entitled (if any)\nbased upon the resolution of the Grievance,\nand the remainder of the set aside tax funds\nshall be distributed by the NBA to one (1) or\nmore Teams or otherwise used by the\nLeague in such manner as the NBA may\nreasonably determine, consistent with the\nprovisions of Section 2(d)(4) above.\n(B)\nWhen a player initiates a Grievance against a Team\nseeking the payment of Compensation for a Season\ncovered by a prior Salary Cap Year that the Team\nasserts is not owed, following resolution of the\nGrievance, whether by award or settlement, the\ndisputed amount payable by the Team, if any, shall\nbe included in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year\nin which the Grievance is resolved (but only to the\nextent that it had been previously excluded from\nTeam Salary).

A Team’s failure to comply with the\npreceding sentence may be considered evidence of a\nviolation of Article XIII. If a Team delays or\nattempts to delay in any manner the processing or\nresolution of a Grievance relating to a player’s\nCompensation for the purpose of creating or\nincreasing its Room in any Salary Cap Year or for the\npurpose of reducing or deferring a tax payment to\nthe NBA, such conduct shall constitute a violation\nof Article XIII.\nSalaries anticipated to be included in Team Salary based\nupon any agreement disclosed to the NBA pursuant to\nArticle II, Section 13(a)(i) (including, without limitation, any\nexecuted Player Contract whose validity is conditional on the\npassage of a physical examination by the player or on the\n216\nArticle VII\nassignment of the Contract), except to the extent that any\nsuch Salary is less than a player’s Free Agent Amount (as\ndefined in Section 4(d) below).\n(2) (i) With respect to each Veteran Free Agent who last played for\na Team who is an Unrestricted Free Agent, the Free Agent\nAmount (as defined in Section 4(d) below) attributable to\nsuch Veteran Free Agent.\n(ii)\nWith respect to each Veteran Free Agent who last played for\na Team who is a Restricted Free Agent, the greater of (A) the\nFree Agent Amount (as defined in Section 4(d) below)\nattributable to such Veteran Free Agent, (B) the Salary called\nfor in any outstanding Qualifying Offer (other than a\nTwo-Way Qualifying Offer, as defined in Article XI,\nSection 1(e)(iii)(B) below) tendered to such Veteran Free\nAgent (or, if the Restricted Free Agent was also tendered a\nMaximum Qualifying Offer pursuant to Article XI,\nSection 4(a)(ii), the Salary called for in such outstanding\nMaximum Qualifying Offer), or (C) the Salary called for in\nany First Refusal Exercise Notice (as defined in Article XI,\nSection 5(g)) issued with respect to such Veteran Free Agent.\n(3) The aggregate Salaries called for under all outstanding Offer\nSheets (as defined in Article XI, Section 5(b)).\n(4) An amount with respect to a Team’s unsigned First Round\nPick, if any, as determined in accordance with Section 4(e) below.\n(5) An amount with respect to the number of players fewer than\ntwelve (12) included in a Team’s Team Salary, as determined in\naccordance with Section 4(f) below.\n(6) Value or consideration received by retired players that is\ndetermined to be includable in Team Salary in accordance with\nArticle XIII, Section 5.\n(7) The amount of any Salary Cap Exception that is deemed\nincluded in Team Salary in accordance with Section 6(n)(2) below.\nArticle VII\n217\n(8) An amount, if any, included in Team Salary in accordance with\nthe Minimum Team Salary rules set forth in Section 2(c)(3) above.\n(b) Expansion.

If, after such following July 1, or any\nsubsequent July 1, the player signs another, or remains under,\ncontract with a non-NBA team, the player’s applicable Rookie Scale\nCap Hold Amount will again be excluded from Team Salary\nbeginning on the date of the contract signing or the first day of the\nRegular Season commencing after such July 1, whichever is later,\nand will again be included in Team Salary at the applicable Rookie\nScale Cap Hold Amount on the following July 1 or the date the\nplayer’s contract ends (or the player is released from his non-NBA\ncontractual obligations), whichever is earlier, unless the Team\nrenounces its exclusive rights to the player in accordance with\nArticle X, Section 4(g).\n(3) A Team that holds draft rights to a First Round Pick may elect\nto have the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Cap Hold Amount\n220\nArticle VII\nexcluded from its Team Salary at any time prior to the first day of\nany Regular Season by providing the NBA with a written statement\nthat the Team will not sign the player during that Salary Cap Year\naccompanied by a written statement from the First Round Pick\nrenouncing his right to accept any outstanding Required Tender\nmade to him by the Team. After making such an election, (i) the\nTeam shall be prohibited from signing the player during that Salary\nCap Year, except in accordance with Section 5(c)(4)(ii) below, (ii) the\nTeam shall continue to possess such rights with respect to the player\nthat the Team possessed pursuant to Article X immediately prior to\nsuch election, and (iii) the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount\nshall be included again in his Team’s Team Salary at the applicable\nRookie Scale Cap Hold Amount on the following July 1. When a\nFirst Round Pick provides a Team with a written statement\nrenouncing his right to accept that year’s outstanding Required\nTender, the Player shall no longer be permitted to accept it.\n(4) For purposes of this Section 4(e), in the event that a First\nRound Pick does not sign a Contract with the Team that holds his\ndraft rights during the Salary Cap Year immediately following the\nDraft in which he was selected (or during the same Salary Cap Year\nin which he was drafted if the Draft occurs on or after July 1), the\n“applicable Rookie Scale Amount” for such First Round Pick\nmeans, with respect to any subsequent Salary Cap Year, the Rookie\nScale Amount that would apply if the player were drafted in the\nDraft immediately preceding such Salary Cap Year at the same draft\nposition at which he was actually selected.\n(f) Incomplete Rosters.\n(1) If at any time from July 1 through the day prior to the first day\nof the Regular Season a Team has fewer than twelve (12) players,\ndetermined in accordance with Section 4(f)(2) below, included in its\nTeam Salary, then the Team’s Team Salary shall be increased by an\namount calculated as follows:\nSTEP 1:\nSubtract from twelve (12) the number of players\nincluded in Team Salary.\nArticle VII\nSTEP 2:\n221\nIf the result in Step 1 is a positive number, multiply the\nresult in Step 1 by the Minimum Annual Salary\napplicable to players with zero (0) Years of Service under\nthe Minimum Annual Salary Scale for that Salary Cap\nYear.\n(2) In determining whether a Team has fewer than twelve (12)\nplayers included in its Team Salary for purposes of Section 4(f)(1)\nabove only, the only players who shall be counted are (i) players\nunder Contract with the Team who are included in Team Salary,\n(ii) Free Agents who are included in Team Salary pursuant to\nSection 4(a)(2) above, (iii) players to whom Offer Sheets have been\ngiven, and (iv) unsigned First Round Picks who are included in Team\nSalary pursuant to Section 4(e) above.\n(g) Renouncing.\n(1) To renounce a Veteran Free Agent, a Team must provide the\nNBA with a written statement renouncing its right to re-sign the\nplayer, effective no earlier than the July 1 following the last Season\ncovered by the player’s Contract. (The NBA shall notify the Players\nAssociation of any such renunciation by email within two (2)\nbusiness days following receipt of notice of such renunciation.) If a\nTeam renounces a Veteran Free Agent, the player will no longer\nqualify as a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early Qualifying Veteran\nFree Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, as the case may\nbe, and the Team will only be permitted to re-sign such player with\nRoom (i.e., the Team cannot sign such player pursuant to Section\n6(b) below), pursuant to the Minimum Player Salary Exception, or\nto a Two-Way Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the\nevent a Team renounces one or more players pursuant to this\nSection 6(g) (or, with respect to a First Round Pick, pursuant to\nArticle X, Section 4(g)) in order to create Room for an Offer Sheet,\nand the offeree-player’s Prior Team subsequently matches the Offer\nSheet and enters into a Contract with that player, the Team may\nrescind the renunciation (in the case where a Team renounces only\none player) or all such renunciations (in the case where the Team\nrenounces more than one player) within two (2) business days of the\ndate the Offer Sheet is matched (or, if the Prior Team conditions its\nmatch on the player reporting for and passing a physical, within\n222\nArticle VII\ntwo (2) business days of the player passing the physical), whereupon\nany such “unrenounced” player may again sign a Player Contract\nwith the Team as a First Round Pick, Qualifying Veteran Free Agent,\nEarly Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran\nFree Agent, as the case may be, and will again be included in his\nPrior Team’s Team Salary at his applicable Free Agent Amount;\nprovided, however, that a Team may not rescind the renunciation of\na player if (i) at the time the player was renounced, the Team’s Team\nSalary was at or below the Salary Cap and “unrenouncing” the player\nwould cause the Team’s Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap, or\n(ii) at the time the player was renounced, the Team’s Team Salary\nwas above the Salary Cap and “unrenouncing” the player would\ncause the Team’s Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap by more than\nthe amount by which the Team’s Team Salary exceeded the Salary\nCap prior to the renunciation.\n(2) A Team cannot renounce any player who is a Restricted Free\nAgent.\n(h) Long-Term Injuries. Any player who suffers a career-ending\ninjury or illness, and whose Contract is terminated by the Team in\naccordance with the NBA waiver procedure, will be excluded from his\nTeam’s Team Salary as follows:\n(1) Subject to Section 4(h)(5) below, a Team may apply to the NBA\nto have the player’s Salary for each remaining Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the Contract excluded from Team Salary beginning on\nthe first anniversary of the date of the last Regular Season, Play-In,\nor playoff game in which the player played; provided, however, that\nif the player played in fewer than ten (10) Regular Season, Play-In,\nand playoff games in the last Season in which he played, then the\nearliest date upon which a Team may apply to the NBA to have the\nplayer’s Salary excluded from its Team Salary in accordance with this\nSection 4(h) shall be the later of (A) sixty (60) days following the\ndate during such Season in which the player last played in a Regular\nSeason, Play-In, or playoff game, and (B) the first anniversary of the\ndate during a prior Season in which the player last played in a Regular\nSeason, Play-In, or playoff game under such Contract.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4(h)(1), a\nTeam may not apply to have a player’s Salary excluded from Team\nArticle VII\n223\nSalary prior to the first anniversary of the date of the first Regular\nSeason game that the player is on the Team’s roster under the\nContract in question.\n(2) The determination of whether a player has suffered a\ncareer-ending injury or illness shall be made by a physician selected\njointly by the NBA and the Players Association or, upon agreement\nof the NBA and the Players Association, a Fitness-to-Play Panel\nestablished under Article XXII. A player shall be deemed to have\nsuffered a career-ending injury or illness if it is determined (i) by such\na physician or Fitness-to-Play Panel that the player has an injury or\nillness that (x) prevents him from playing skilled professional\nbasketball at an NBA level for the duration of his career, or\n(y) substantially impairs his ability to play skilled professional\nbasketball at an NBA level and is of such severity that continuing to\nplay professional basketball at an NBA level would subject the player\nto medically unacceptable risk of suffering a life-threatening or\npermanently disabling injury or illness, or (ii) by such Fitness-to-Play\nPanel that the player has an injury or illness that would create a\nmaterially elevated risk of death, paralysis, or other permanent spinal\ninjury for the player under the procedures set forth in Article XXII,"

For clarity, a Team that acquires one (1) or\nmore players in accordance with this Section 6(j)(1)(v) (or\nwith room under the Salary Cap (i.e., without making use of\nthe additional $250,000)) may not simultaneously acquire\nany players in accordance with Sections 6(j)(1)(i)-(iv) above.\n242\nArticle VII\n(2) In lieu of conducting a trade in accordance with\nSection 6(j)(1)(v) above, and notwithstanding Section 6(n) below\nand subject to Section 2(e) above and Section 6(j)(6) below, a Team\nwith a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may conduct a trade in\naccordance with Sections 6(j)(1)(iii)-(iv) above.\n(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6(j)(1)\nabove, if a Team’s post-assignment Apron Team Salary would\nexceed the First Apron Level, then the $250,000 allowance\nreferenced in each of Sections 6(j)(1)(i)-(v) above shall be reduced\nto $0.\n(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6(j)(1)\nabove, the following rules will apply when a Team is aggregating the\nContracts of two (2) or more Traded Players in a trade pursuant to\na Traded Player Exception set forth in Section 6(j)(1)(ii), 6(j)(1)(iii),\nor 6(j)(1)(iv) above:\n(i)\nNo player whose Player Contract was acquired pursuant to\nan Exception in the two (2) month period preceding the\ntrade may be among the Traded Players whose Contracts are\nbeing aggregated pursuant to Sections 6(j)(ii), 6(j)(iii), or\n6(j)(iv) above (for example, if a player were traded to a Team\npursuant to an Exception on November 20, 2023, then the\nplayer’s Contract could not be aggregated with any other\nContract for purposes of a trade until January 20, 2024);\nprovided, however, that if a Team acquires a Player Contract\npursuant to an Exception on or before December 16 of a\nSalary Cap Year, then the foregoing restriction shall not\napply in the event the player is subsequently traded on or\nafter the day prior to the NBA trade deadline of such Salary\nCap Year; and\n(ii)\nOther than during the period beginning on December 15 of\na Salary Cap Year through the NBA trade deadline of such\nSalary Cap Year, if a Team is aggregating the Contracts of\nthree (3) or more Traded Players in a trade and the number\nof Replacement Players that the Team is acquiring in respect\nof such Traded Players is less than the number of such\nTraded Players, then no more than one (1) of such Traded\nArticle VII\n243\nPlayers may be a Minimum Traded Player (as defined\nbelow). For the purposes of this rule only, a “Minimum\nTraded Player” is a player whose Contract provides for his\napplicable Minimum Player Salary for the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich the trade of his Contract occurs or, if the trade occurs\nduring the period beginning on the day after the last day of\nthe Regular Season of a Salary Cap Year through the last day\nof such Salary Cap Year, a player whose Contract provides\nfor his applicable Minimum Player Salary in the immediately\nfollowing Salary Cap Year.\n(5) If (x) a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or Early Qualifying\nVeteran Free Agent and his prior Team enter into a Player Contract,\nin accordance with Section 6(b)(1) or (3) above, in connection with\nan agreement to trade the Contract in accordance with Section 8(e)\nbelow, (y) the Team’s Team Salary immediately following such\nContract signing is above the Salary Cap, and (z) the new Contract\nto be traded provides for Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first\nSeason of such Contract in excess of the Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses that could have been provided for by the Contract had the\nplayer been a Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent and the Contract\nhad been signed pursuant to Section 6(b)(2) above, then for\npurposes of calculating the assignor Team’s Traded Player\nException, the player’s Salary shall be deemed equal to the greater\nof (i) the Salary for the last Season of his preceding Contract, or\n(ii) fifty percent (50%) of the Salary for the first Season of his new\nContract. For purposes of this Section 6(j)(5), if the player’s\nimmediately prior Contract was a one-year Contract that provided\nfor Salary equal to the Minimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of\nany kind), the player’s prior Salary shall include the portion of the\nMinimum Player Salary, if any, that was reimbursed out of the\nLeague-wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section 6(h).\n(6) For purposes of calculating a Team’s Traded Player Exception\nunder this Section 6(j), a Traded Player’s Salary shall be deemed\nreduced by the amount of the player’s unearned Base Compensation\nthat, at the time of the trade, is not fully protected for lack of skill\nand injury or illness (or may become not fully protected for lack of\nskill and injury or illness due to additional conditions or limitations\n244\nArticle VII\nset forth in the Exhibit 2 of the player’s Contract). For purposes of\nthis Section 6(j)(6):\n(i)\nWith respect to the assignment of Player Contracts\noccurring during the period from January 8 through the last\nday of the Regular Season, a Traded Player’s Base\nCompensation for such Season shall be deemed fully\nprotected for lack of skill and injury or illness;\n(ii)\nWith respect to the assignment of a Player Contract that is a\none-year Contract that provides for Salary equal to the\nMinimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind), the\nplayer’s unearned Base Compensation shall exclude the\nportion of the Minimum Player Salary, if any, that is\nreimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund described\nin Article IV, Section 6(h); and\n(iii)\nWith respect to the assignment of Player Contracts\noccurring during the period from the day following the last\nday of a Regular Season through June 30 of that Salary Cap\nYear, a Traded Player’s Salary will equal the lesser of: (x) the\nplayer’s Salary for the current Salary Cap Year; and (y) the\nplayer’s Salary for the subsequent Salary Cap Year reduced\nby the amount of the player’s unearned Base Compensation\nfor the subsequent Salary Cap Year that, at the time of the\ntrade, is not fully protected for lack of skill and injury or\nillness (or may become not fully protected for lack of skill\nand injury or illness due to additional conditions or\nlimitations set forth in the Exhibit 2 of the player’s\nContract).\nTo illustrate the foregoing, assume that a Team seeks to replace a\nTraded Player whose Contract provides for (i) Base Compensation and\nSalary for each of the 2023-24 and 2024-25 Seasons of $8 million,\nand (ii) Base Compensation protection for lack of skill and injury or\nillness equal to $1 million for each such Season. If the trade of such\nTraded Player occurs on:\n(W) the day prior to the first day of the 2023-24 Regular Season, the\nTraded Player’s Salary for purposes of calculating the Team’s Traded\nArticle VII\n245\nPlayer Exception under this Section 6(j) would be $1 million\n($8 million (the player’s 2023-24 Salary) reduced by $7 million (the\namount of the player’s unearned 2023-24 Base Compensation that is\nnot fully protected for lack of skill and injury or illness at the time of\nthe trade));\n(X) after one-quarter of the 2023-24 Regular Season has elapsed, the\nTraded Player’s Salary for purposes of calculating the Team’s Traded\nPlayer Exception under this Section 6(j) would be $2 million ($8\nmillion (the player’s 2023-24 Salary) reduced by $6 million ($8\nmillion multiplied by 75% – the amount of the player’s unearned\n2023-24 Base Compensation that is not fully protected for lack of skill\nand injury or illness at the time of the trade));\n(Y) on January 8, 2024, the Traded Player’s Salary for purposes of\ncalculating the Team’s Traded Player Exception under this Section 6(j)\nwould be $8 million ($8 million (the player’s 2023-24 Salary) reduced\nby $0 (pursuant to Section 6(j)(6)(i) above, the deemed amount of the\nplayer’s unearned 2023-24 Base Compensation that is not fully\nprotected for lack of skill and injury or illness at the time of the trade));\nand\n(Z) on the day following the last day of the 2023-24 Regular Season,\nthe Traded Player’s Salary for purposes of calculating the Team’s\nTraded Player Exception under this Section 6(j) would be $1 million\n(the lesser of: (i) $8 million ($8 million (the player’s 2023-24 Salary)\nreduced by $0 (the amount of the player’s unearned 2023-24 Base\nCompensation that is not fully protected for lack of skill and injury or\nillness at the time of the trade)), and (ii) $1 million ($8 million (the\nplayer’s 2024-25 Salary) reduced by $7 million (the amount of the\nplayer’s unearned 2024-25 Base Compensation that is not fully\nprotected for lack of skill and injury or illness at the time of the trade)).\n(7) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(j),\nno Traded Player Exception shall arise from trading a player during\na Salary Cap Year if the Team has previously used (or simultaneously\nuses) a Disabled Player Exception in respect of such player during\nsuch Salary Cap Year.\n246\nArticle VII\n(8) The foregoing rules in this Section 6(j) shall not apply to\nTwo-Way Players. Accordingly, for example, a Traded Player\nException will not arise from trading a Two-Way Player.\n(k) Second Round Pick Exception. A Team that holds the draft\nrights to a Second Round Pick may use the Second Round Pick Exception\nto sign such player to a Player Contract in accordance with the following:\n(1) The term of a Player Contract signed pursuant to the Second\nRound Pick Exception must be either: (i) two (2) Seasons with an\nOption in favor of the Team for a third Season; or (ii) three (3)\nSeasons with an Option in favor of the Team for a fourth Season.\n(2) If a Player Contract signed pursuant to the Second Round Pick\nException has a term of two (2) Seasons with an Option in favor of\nthe Team for a third Season, then such Contract must provide for:\n(i)\nSalary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the\nMinimum Player Salary applicable to a player with one (1)\nYear of Service; and\n(ii)\nthe player’s applicable Minimum Player Salary for the second\nSeason and the Option Year.\nFor clarity, the foregoing amounts shall be those as set forth in the\nMinimum Annual Scale for the Salary Cap Year in which the\nContract is signed.\n(3) If a Player Contract signed pursuant to the Second Round Pick\nException has a term of three (3) Seasons with an Option in favor\nof the Team for a fourth Season, then such Contract must provide\nfor:\n(i)\nSalary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the\nMinimum Player Salary applicable to a player with two (2)\nYear of Service;\n(ii)\nSalary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the second Season of up to\nthe amount shown in the “Year 2” column for a player with\ntwo (2) Years of Service in the Minimum Annual Salary\nScale; and\nArticle VII\n(iii)\n247\nthe player’s applicable Minimum Player Salary for the third\nSeason and the Option Year.\nFor clarity, the foregoing amounts shall be those as set forth in the\nMinimum Annual Scale for the Salary Cap Year in which the\nContract is signed.\n(4) For Player Contracts signed in accordance with Section 6(k)(3)\nabove, annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses from the first Season to the second Season shall be\ngoverned by Section 5(a)(1) above.\n(l) Reinstatement. If a player has been dismissed and disqualified\nfrom further association with the NBA and subsequently reinstated\npursuant to Article XXXIII (Anti-Drug Agreement), the Team for which\nthe player last played may enter into a Player Contract with such player in\naccordance with the applicable rules set forth in Article XXXIII,\nSection 13(f) or (g), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the\nSalary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a Team Salary\nabove the Salary Cap. If, in accordance with the preceding sentence, a Team\nand a player enter into a Player Contract and such Contract covers more\nthan one (1) Season, annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses shall be governed by Section 5(a)(1) above.\n(m) Non-Aggregation. Other than in accordance with Section 6(j)\nabove, a Team may not aggregate or combine any of the Exceptions set\nforth above in order to sign or acquire one (1) or more players at Salaries\ngreater than that permitted by any one of the Exceptions. If a Team has\nmore than one (1) Exception available at the same time, the Team shall have\nthe right to choose which Exception it wishes to use to sign or acquire a\nplayer.\n(n) Other Rules.\n(1) A Team shall be entitled to use the Disabled Player Exception,\nBi-annual Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception,\nTaxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception, and a Traded Player\nException set forth in Sections 6(c), (d), (e), (f), and (j) above,\nrespectively, except as set forth in Sections 6(j)(1)(v) and 6(j)(2)\nabove, only if, at the time any such Exception would arise and at all\n248\nArticle VII\ntimes until it is used, the Team’s Team Salary, excluding the\namount(s) of such Exception and any other Exception that would\nbe included in Team Salary pursuant to Section 6(n)(2) below, is (i) at\nor above the Salary Cap, or (ii) below the Salary Cap by less than the\namount(s) of the Team’s Exception(s) (excluding the amount of the\nTaxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception unless the Team is no longer\nable to use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception but\nremains able to use the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception, in\nwhich case the amount of the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception\nshall be included).\n(2) In the event that when a Disabled Player Exception, Bi-annual\nException, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception (or the\nTaxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception instead of the Non-Taxpayer\nMid-Level Salary Exception if the Team is no longer able to use the\nNon-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception but remains able to use\nthe Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception), and/or a Traded Player\nException arises, the Team’s Team Salary is below the Salary Cap\n(or in the event that, prior to the expiration of any such Exceptions,\nthe Team’s Team Salary falls below the Salary Cap) by less than the\namount of such Exceptions, then (i) the Team’s Team Salary shall\ninclude, until the Exceptions are actually used or until the Team no\nlonger is entitled to use the Exceptions, the amount of the\nExceptions (or any unused portion of the Exceptions), and (ii) the\namount by which the Team’s Team Salary is less than the Salary Cap\nshall thereby be extinguished. When the Disabled Player Exception\nis used to sign or acquire a player, the Replacement Player’s Salary\nfor the Season covered by his Contract, instead of the amount of the\nException, shall be included in Team Salary. When a Bi-annual\nException, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception, Taxpayer\nMid-Level Salary Exception, or Traded Player Exception is used to\nsign or acquire a player (as applicable), the Salary for the first Season\nof the signed Contract or the Salary for the then-current Salary Cap\nYear of the acquired Contract (as applicable), plus any then-unused\nportion of the Exception (instead of the full amount of the\nException), shall be included in Team Salary. A Team may at any\ntime renounce its rights to use an Exception, in which case the\nException (or any unused portion of the Exception) will no longer\nbe included in Team Salary.\nArticle VII\n249\n(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if\na player is a Veteran Free Agent following the second or third Season\nof his Rookie Scale Contract (where the first Option Year or second\nOption Year (as applicable) to extend such Contract was not\nexercised), then any new Player Contract between the player and the\nTeam that signed him to his Rookie Scale Contract (and/or, if such\nContract was subsequently assigned, any such assignee Team) may\nprovide for Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses in\nthe first Salary Cap Year of up to the Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses,\nand Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, that the player would have\nreceived for such Salary Cap Year had his first or second Option\nYear (as applicable) been exercised.

In the event that\nthe last Salary Cap Year covered by the original term provides for\nIncentive Compensation and such Incentive Compensation is also\nrenegotiated, the amount of Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses\nin the first Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term may\ndecrease by up to forty percent (40%) of the player’s Likely Bonuses\nArticle VII\n257\nand Unlikely Bonuses, respectively (as renegotiated), in the last\nSalary Cap Year covered by the original term.\n(3) A Contract that is amended pursuant to Article XXIV,\nSection 2(a)(iii)(B)(3) to waive all or any portion of a trade bonus in\nconnection with the trade of a Player Contract may not be\nsubsequently renegotiated until the later of (i) six (6) months from\nthe date of the trade, or (ii) the first date on which the Contract could\notherwise be renegotiated pursuant to this Section 7.\n(4) In connection with the trade of a Player Contract,\nnotwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article XII, Section 2(a),\na player and the assignor Team may agree upon an amendment to\nthe Contract providing for the exercise or non-exercise of an Option\ncontained in the Contract by a player or Team (as the case may be),\nprovided that the amendment also provides that (i) the player will be\ntraded to the assignee Team within a specified period of time not to\nexceed forty-eight (48) hours of the execution of the amendment,\nand (ii) such trade and the consummation of such trade are\nconditions precedent to the validity of the amendment.\n(5) In the event that a Team and a player agree to amend a Player\nContract in accordance with Article II, Section 3(p), then: (i) for\npurposes of calculating the player’s Salary for the then-current and\nany remaining Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract,\nnotwithstanding any stretch of the player’s protected Compensation\npayment schedule, the aggregate reduction in the player’s protected\nCompensation, if any, shall be allocated pro rata over the\nthen-current and each remaining Salary Cap Year on the basis of the\nremaining unearned protected Base Compensation in each such\nSalary Cap Year; and (ii) the Team shall not be permitted to sign the\nplayer to a new Player Contract (or claim the player off of waivers)\nbefore the later of: (x) one (1) year following the date that the\nplayer’s Player Contract with such Team was terminated; or (y) the\nJuly 1 following the last Season of such Player Contract.\n(6) (i) For any Contract terminated on or after the first day of the\n2023-24 Salary Cap Year, the following rules shall apply for purposes\nof determining a Team’s Team Salary in circumstances where the\nContract is terminated prior to the September 1 preceding the final\n258\nArticle VII\nSeason covered by the Contract and, prior to such September 1, the\nTeam elects to have the player’s Salary for the then-current and any\nremaining Salary Cap Years stretched (i.e., re-attributed):\n(ii)\n(A)\nin the event the Team so elects during the period\nfrom September 1 through the following June 30 of\na Salary Cap Year, (i) the player’s post-termination\nSalary for the then-current Salary Cap Year (after\ngiving effect to the provisions of Section (d)(5)\nabove, if applicable) shall remain unchanged, and\n(ii) the player’s post-termination Salary for each\nremaining Salary Cap Year (after giving effect to the\nprovisions of Section (d)(5) above, if applicable)\nshall be aggregated and allocated evenly over a\nnumber of Salary Cap Years equal to twice the\nnumber of Seasons (including any Player Option\nYear) remaining on the Contract following the Salary\nCap Year in which the election occurred, plus\none (1) Season; or\n(B)\nin the event the Team so elects during the period\nfrom July 1 through August 31 of a Salary Cap Year,\nthe player’s post-termination Salary for the\nthen-current and any remaining Salary Cap Years\n(after giving effect to the provisions of Section (d)(5)\nabove, if applicable) shall be aggregated and\nallocated evenly over a number of Salary Cap Years\nequal to twice the number of Seasons (including any\nPlayer Option Year) remaining on the Contract\nfollowing the date of the election (including the\nupcoming Season), plus one (1) Season.\nTo make an election pursuant to Section 7(d)(6)(i) above, a\nTeam must provide the NBA with a written statement\nelecting to stretch the player’s Salary.

Should the player consent (or if the player\nand Team agreed at the time of signing to eliminate his right to consent)\nand the player is traded (except if the Contract has an Option for the\nsecond year that was exercised prior to the trade), then, for purposes of\ndetermining whether the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early\nQualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent at\nthe conclusion of the Contract or any subsequent Contract between the\nplayer and the assignee Team, the player shall be considered as having\nchanged Teams by means of signing a Contract with the assignee Team as\nArticle VII\n261\na Free Agent (and not by means of trade). For clarity, for any player who\ndid not agree at the time of signing to eliminate his right to consent, such\nright under this Section 8(b) shall continue following the initial trade of\nthe player’s Contract and any proposed subsequent trade of such Contract\nduring the term thereof (not including any Option Year).\n(c) A Team cannot trade any player after the NBA trade deadline\noccurring in the last Season of the player’s Contract, or after the NBA\ntrade deadline occurring in any Season that could be the last Season of the\nplayer’s Contract based upon the exercise or non-exercise of an Option or\nEarly Termination Option.\n(d) (i)\nNo Draft Rookie who signs a Standard NBA Contract or\nplayer who signs a Two-Way Contract may be traded\nbefore thirty (30) days following the date on which the\nContract is signed.\n(ii)\nNo player who signs a Standard NBA Contract as a Free\nAgent (or who signs a Standard NBA Contract while under\na Two-Way Contract) may be traded before the later of\n(A) three (3) months following the date on which such\nContract was signed or (B) the December 15 of the Salary\nCap Year in which such Contract was signed; provided,\nthat if a Contract is signed in connection with an\nagreement to trade the Contract in accordance with\nSection 8(e) below, the foregoing rule shall not apply to the\ninitial trade but shall instead be applicable if the Contract\nis traded a second time. For the purposes of this rule, a\nTwo-Way Contract that is converted to a Standard NBA\nContract pursuant to such Contract’s Standard NBA\nContract Conversion Option will be deemed to be a\nStandard NBA Contract signed by a Free Agent on the\ndate of the conversion.\n(iii)\nNotwithstanding the rule set forth in Section (d)(ii) above,\nany player who signs a Standard NBA Contract with his\nprior Team meeting the following criteria may not be\ntraded before the later of (x) three (3) months following\nthe date on which such Contract was signed or (y) the\nJanuary 15 of the Salary Cap Year in which such Contract\n262\nArticle VII\nwas signed: the Team Salary of the player’s Team is above\nthe Salary Cap immediately following the Contract signing\nand the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or Early\nQualifying Veteran Free Agent who, in accordance with\nSection 6(b)(1) or (3) above, enters into a new Player\nContract with his prior Team that provides for a Salary for\nthe first Season of such new Contract greater than one\nhundred twenty percent (120%) of the Salary for the last\nSeason of the player’s immediately prior Contract. The\nrule set forth in this Section (d)(iii) shall not apply to a\nplayer if his new Contract provides for Salary equal to the\nMinimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind). For\npurposes of the foregoing sentence, if the player’s\nimmediately prior Contract was a one-year Contract that\nprovided for Salary equal to the Minimum Player Salary\n(with no bonuses of any kind), the player’s prior Salary\nshall include the portion of the Minimum Player Salary, if\nany, that was reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits\nfund described in Article IV, Section 6(h).\n(e) (1) Subject to the rules set forth in Section 2(e) above, a Veteran\nFree Agent and his Prior Team may enter into a Player Contract\npursuant to an agreement between the Prior Team and another\nTeam concerning the signing and subsequent trade of such\nContract, but only if (i) the Veteran Free Agent finished the prior\nSeason on his Prior Team’s roster, (ii) the Contract is for at least\nthree (3) Seasons (excluding any Option Year) but no more than\nfour (4) Seasons in length, (iii) the Contract is not signed pursuant\nto the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception or the\nMid-Level Salary Exception for Room Teams, (iv) the first Season\nof the Contract is fully protected for lack of skill, (v) the Contract\nis entered into prior to the first day of the Regular Season, (vi) with\nrespect to any 5th Year Eligible Player (as defined in Article II,\nSection 7) who met one of the Higher Max Criteria (as defined in\nArticle II, Section 7), the Contract may not provide the player with\nSalary (plus Unlikely Bonuses) in excess of twenty-five percent\n(25%) of the Salary Cap (as calculated pursuant to Article II,\nSection 7) in effect at the time the Contract is signed, and (vii) the\nacquiring Team has Room for the player’s Salary plus any Unlikely\nBonuses provided for in the first Season of the Contract.\nArticle VII\n263\n(2) A player and his Team may amend a Player Contract\n(including by entering into an Extension but not by entering into\na Renegotiation) pursuant to an agreement between such Team\nand another Team concerning the signing of the amendment and\nsubsequent trade of the amended Contract; provided, however,\nthat: (i) no such agreement may be made during the period from\nthe last day of the last Regular Season covered by the Contract (or\nthe last day of any Regular Season that could be the last Regular\nSeason covered by the Contract based upon the exercise or\nnon-exercise of an Option or ETO) through the following\nJune 30; (ii) no such Extension entered into pursuant to this\nSection 8(e)(2) prior to the first day of the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year\nmay cover more than three (3) Seasons from the date the\nExtension is signed; and (iii) no such Extension entered into\npursuant to this Section 8(e)(2) on or after the first day of the\n2024-25 Salary Cap Year may cover more than four (4) Seasons\nfrom the date the Extension is signed. The Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses that may be provided in the first year of the extended\nterm and annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses shall be governed by Section 7(a)(3)(iii) and\nSection 5(a)(4) above.\n(3) A Player Contract or Extension entered into pursuant to\nSection 8(e)(1) or (2) above may not contain an Exhibit 6 thereto.\nHowever, the preceding sentence shall not prohibit the Teams\ninvolved in the trade from agreeing that the trade (and thus the\nvalidity of the Player Contract or Extension) will be conditional\nupon the passage of a physical examination to be performed by a\nphysician designated by the assignee-Team in accordance with\nNBA procedures.\n(f) (i)\nIn the event a player enters into (A) an Extension pursuant\nto Section 7(a) above (other than a Designated Veteran\nPlayer Extension governed by Section (f)(ii) below) that\ncovers five (5) Seasons (or, for Extensions entered into\nprior to the first day of the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year,\nfour (4) or more Seasons) and/or provides for Salary and\nUnlikely Bonuses or annual increases or decreases in the\nplayer’s Salary and Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the\namounts that, at the time such Extension was entered into,\n264\nArticle VII\nwere permissible in Extensions entered into in connection\nwith an agreement to trade the Contract pursuant to\nSection 8(e)(2) above, or (B) a Renegotiation pursuant to\nSection 7(c) above, then the player may not be traded\nbefore six (6) months following the date on which such\nExtension or Renegotiation was signed. If a team acquires\na player in a trade, then, for a period of six (6) months\nfollowing the date of the trade, the team may not enter into\n(X) an Extension with the player pursuant to Section 7(a)\nabove that covers five (5) Seasons (or, if the trade occurred\nprior to the first day of the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year,\nfour (4) or more Seasons) and/or provides for Salary and\nUnlikely Bonuses or annual increases or decreases in the\nplayer’s Salary and/or Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the\namounts that, at the time such trade occurred, were\npermissible in Extensions entered into in connection with\nan agreement to trade the Contract pursuant to\nSection 8(e)(2) above, or (Y) a Renegotiation pursuant to\nSection 7(c) above.\n(ii)\nIn the event a player enters into a Designated Veteran\nPlayer Extension pursuant to Section 7(a)(3)(ii) above or a\nDesignated Veteran Player Contract pursuant to Article II,\nSection 7, the player may not be traded before one (1) year\nfollowing the date on which he entered into such\nDesignated Veteran Player Extension or Designated\nVeteran Player Contract.\n(g) In the event a Rookie Scale Contract is extended pursuant to\nSection 7(b) above and a Team proposes to trade such Contract to another\nTeam prior to the first day of the Salary Cap Year immediately following\nsuch Extension, then, only for purposes of determining whether the\nacquiring Team has Room for the Contract, the Salary for the last Salary\nCap Year of the original term of the Contract shall be deemed to equal the\naverage of the aggregate Salaries for such Salary Cap Year and each Salary\nCap Year of the extended term. For purposes of this subsection (g), the\nSalary for each Salary Cap Year of the extended term of the Contract shall\nbe the Salary as set forth in the Contract; provided, however, that:\nArticle VII\n265\n(i)\nIf the Contract provides for Base Compensation in the\nfirst Salary Cap Year of the extended term that is expressed\nas a percentage of the Salary Cap in accordance with\nArticle II, Section 7(d), then the Base Compensation in the\nextended term of the Contract shall be determined\nassuming that (a) the Salary Cap in the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term will equal one hundred four\nand one-half percent (104.5%) of the Salary Cap in effect\nat the time that the proposed trade would occur, and\n(b) the player does not meet any of the applicable Higher\nMax Criteria during the fourth Season of his Rookie Scale\nContract; or\n(ii)\nIf the Contract provides for Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses\nin the first Salary Cap Year of the extended term that\nexceeds the applicable Maximum Annual Salary that would\napply to such player assuming that the Salary Cap in the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term will\nequal one hundred four and one-half percent (104.5%) of\nthe Salary Cap in effect at the time that the proposed trade\nwould occur, then the Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the\nextended term of the Contract shall be determined to be\nthe Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses that would result from\nthe deemed amendment(s) pursuant to Article II,\nSection 7(c) using the assumption described above in this\nsubsection (ii).\n(h) If a Team trades a player and the assignee Team subsequently\nplaces the player on waivers, the assignor Team shall not be permitted to\nsign the player to a new Contract (or claim the player off of waivers) before\nthe earlier of: (i) one (1) year following the date all conditions to the trade\nwere satisfied; or (ii) the July 1 following the last Season of the player’s\nPlayer Contract.\n(i) Prior to the assignment of any Player Contract, the Team from\nwhich such Player Contract is to be assigned and the player whose Player\nContract is to be assigned shall be required to divest themselves, on terms\nmutually agreeable to the player and the Team, of any preexisting financial\narrangements between such Team and such player. The foregoing shall\n266\nArticle VII\nnot apply to Compensation earned by the player prior to the assignment\nor to loans.\n(j) As soon as is practicable following each trade (but in no event later\nthan one (1) week from the date of the trade), the NBA shall send to the\nPlayers Association, by email, a summary of the principal terms of the\ntrade; provided, however, that the NBA may omit from such summary any\nterms that the NBA or one (1) or more Teams involved in the trade\nreasonably deem confidential (other than such terms as may be necessary\nto verify the Teams’ compliance with Section 8(a) above).\n(k) A “trade” of a player under this Agreement shall mean an\nassignment of a Player Contract pursuant to a negotiated exchange\nbetween two or more Teams following a trade conference call with the\nNBA league office. For clarity, the word “trade” shall not include an\nassignment of a player via the NBA’s waiver procedures."

To the extent the\nactual amounts of revenues received or expenses incurred for a Salary Cap\nYear differ from such estimates, adjustments shall be made in BRI for the\nfollowing Salary Cap Year in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 10(f) below.\n(d) With respect to deducted expenses, except for Newly-Deductible\nInternational Expenses, the NBA, League-related entities, Teams, and\nRelated Parties shall report in BRI Reports only those expenses that are\nreasonable and customary in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 1(a) above. Subject to the terms of Section 1(a)(6) and\nSection 1(a)(14) above, and Section 11 below, all categories of expenses\ndeducted in a BRI Report completed by the NBA or a Team shall be\nreviewed by the Accountants, but such categories shall be presumed to be\n270\nArticle VII\nreasonable and customary and the amount of the expenses deducted by\nthe NBA or a Team that come within such expense categories shall also\nbe presumed to be reasonable and customary, unless such categories or\namounts are found by the Accountants to be either unrelated to the\nrevenues involved or grossly excessive.\n(e) The Accountants shall notify designated representatives of the\nNBA and the Players Association: (1) if the Accountants have any\nquestions concerning the amounts of revenues or expenses reported by\nthe Teams and the NBA or any other information contained in the BRI\nReports; or (2) if the Accountants propose that any adjustments be made\nto any revenue or expense item or any other information contained in the\nBRI Reports.\n(f) The Accountants shall indicate which amounts included in BRI for\na Salary Cap Year, if any, represent estimates of revenues or expenses.\nWith respect to any such estimated revenues or expenses, the Accountants\nshall, in preparing the Audit Report for the immediately succeeding Salary\nCap Year (“Subsequent Audit Report”), or the Audit Report for the same\nSalary Cap Year in the event that an Interim Audit Report was previously\nissued for that Salary Cap Year, determine the actual revenues and\nexpenses received for the prior Salary Cap Year and include as a credit or\ndebit to BRI in such Subsequent Audit Report the amount of the aggregate\ndifference, if any, between all such estimated revenues and expenses for\nthe prior Salary Cap Year and the actual revenues and expenses received\nfor such Salary Cap Year.\n(g) In the event that in the course of preparing an Audit Report for a\nSalary Cap Year the Accountants discover that they committed an error in\ncomputing BRI in the Audit Reports for either of the two (2) previous\nSalary Cap Years, which error resulted in a material understatement or\noverstatement of BRI for either of such Salary Cap Years, and the parties\nagree that such error was committed and agree as to the amount of the\nresulting understatement or overstatement (or, if they do not agree, an\nerror (and the amount of such error) is established pursuant to the dispute\nresolution procedures provided for in this Agreement) the amount of such\nunderstatement or overstatement of BRI shall be added to or subtracted\nfrom BRI, as the case may be, with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1)\nyear Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of\nthe issuance of such Audit Report) accruing from the date of the Audit\nArticle VII\n271\nReport for the Salary Cap Year in which such understatement or\noverstatement occurred in equal annual amounts over the then-current\nand subsequent Salary Cap Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\nparties will jointly instruct the Accountants that their audits shall not\ninclude procedures specifically designed to detect errors committed in\nprior audits.\n(h) In the event that there is an NHL players’ strike or owners’ lockout\n(“work stoppage”) resulting in the cancellation of all or part of any NHL\nseason in any Salary Cap Year, and such work stoppage results in a refund\nbeing made to luxury suite-holders, premium seat license-holders, or to\npurchasers of fixed arena signage and/or naming rights in arenas in which\nboth an NBA Team and an NHL team plays its home games, then the\nrevenues for luxury suites, premium seat licenses, and fixed arena signage\nand/or naming rights in such arenas shall be determined as if such refunds\nwere not made. If the work stoppage continues for a second year, then\nthe NHL revenues shall be deemed to be the amount included for the\nprior year.\n(i) All disputes with respect to any Interim Audit Report shall be\nresolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in\nArticle XXXII.\n(j) In the event of a trade that (i) occurs after the final Audit Report for\na Salary Cap Year is submitted by the Accountants and before the\nconclusion of such Salary Cap Year, and (ii) results in a player earning a trade\nbonus, the final Audit Report shall be amended to reflect such trade bonus\nfor purposes of calculating such player’s Salary and the Team’s Team Salary\n(and thus, for clarity, for the purposes of computing the amount of tax the\nTeam owes pursuant to Article VII, Section 2(d)); however, the portion of\nsuch trade bonus that is included in the Team’s Team Salary for such Salary\nCap Year shall be excluded from Total Salaries for such Salary Cap Year,\nand included in Total Salaries for the immediately following Salary Cap Year.\nSection 11. Players Association Audit Rights.\n(a) Team Audits. The Players Association shall have the right as part\nof the annual review of BRI Reports to retain its own accountants (the\n“Players Association’s Accountants”), at its own expense, after the\nsubmission of each Audit Report under this Agreement, to audit the books\n272\nArticle VII\nand records of NBA teams (of its choosing), with the number of such audits\nin each Salary Cap Year set forth below (the “First Audit”); provided,\nhowever, that such review shall be limited to (i) revenue items (including in\nrespect of equity transactions subject to Section 1(a)(13) above), and\n(ii) expense items, in each case that appear or should have appeared in the\nBRI Reports. In the event that, in the opinion of the Players Association’s\nAccountants, such audit indicates misallocations or miscategorizations of\nrevenues or expenses (other than with respect to matters that constituted\nDisputed Adjustments in connection with the prior Audit Report) resulting\nin an understatement of BRI, they shall submit to the NBA proposed\nadjustments to BRI consistent with their findings. In the event that the\nNBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments shall\nbe deemed to be “Disputed Adjustments” and shall be resolved in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII. In addition, in\nthe event that First Audit Disputed Adjustments in excess of $8 million are\nresolved in favor of the Players Association, the Players Association shall\nthen have the right, that Season, to have the Players Association’s\nAccountants audit up to an additional ten (10) NBA teams for the same\nSalary Cap Year, in accordance with the foregoing procedures (the “Second\nAudit”). If, as a result of the Second Audit, additional Disputed\nAdjustments in excess of $8 million are resolved in favor of the Players\nAssociation, the Players Association shall then have the right, that Season,\nto have the Players Association’s Accountants audit all remaining NBA\nTeams for that Salary Cap Year. The amount of any and all Disputed\nAdjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the Players Association\nin accordance with this Section 11(a) shall be added to BRI in the Salary Cap\nYear in which such resolution is reached. The aggregate number of NBA\nTeams selected for the First Audit by the Players Association over the course\nof the first six (6) Salary Cap Years of the CBA will be ninety (90), to be\ndistributed over the Salary Cap Years at the Players Association’s option.\nFor the seventh Salary Cap Year of the CBA, the Players Association will be\nentitled to select fifteen (15) NBA Teams for First Audits, supplemented by\nany of the ninety (90) audits that were not used in a previous Salary Cap\nYear.\n(b) League Audit. The Players Association shall have the right as part\nof the annual review of BRI Reports to retain the Players Association’s\nAccountants to conduct an audit, at its own expense, of the books and\nrecords of the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, and other League-related\nentities associated with generating BRI, provided, however, that such audit\nArticle VII\n273\nshall be limited to (i) revenue items (including in respect of equity\ntransactions subject to Section 1(a)(13) above) and (ii) expense items,\nregardless of whether such expenses exceed the applicable BRI ratio of\nexpenses to revenues set forth in Exhibit D, in each case that appear or\nshould have appeared in the BRI Report. In the event that, in the opinion\nof the Players Association’s Accountants, such audit indicates misallocations\nor miscategorizations of revenues or expenses (other than with respect to\nmatters that constituted League Disputed Adjustments in connection with\nthe prior Audit Report) resulting in an understatement of BRI, they shall\nsubmit proposed adjustments to the NBA consistent with their findings. In\nthe event that the NBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed\nadjustments shall be deemed to be League Disputed Adjustments and\nresolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII. The\namount of any and all such League Disputed Adjustments that are resolved\nin the Players Association’s favor shall be included in BRI in the Salary Cap\nYear in which such resolution is reached. In addition, in the event that any\nsuch League Disputed Adjustments are resolved in the Players Association’s\nfavor, the Accountants shall be directed to correct such expense\nmisallocations and/or miscategorizations in the remaining Salary Cap Years\ncovered by the Agreement.\n(c) Confidentiality. In connection with any audit conducted by the\nPlayers Association pursuant to this Section 11, the Players Association\nagrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a confidentiality\nagreement in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit J-1. The Players\nAssociation also agrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a\nsimilar confidentiality agreement with respect to information obtained in\nconnection with the Accountants’ audit pursuant to Section 10 above.\n(d) Preceding\nSalary\nCap\nYear\nAudit\nAdjustments.\nNotwithstanding anything else in this Agreement or any release in the annual\nBRI letter agreement, if upward or downward adjustments are made in\nconnection with a Players Association-initiated audit, an adjustment to BRI\nin respect of the same item can also be made for revenues or expenses\nrelated to the preceding Salary Cap Year, if applicable. For example, without\nlimitation, if, based on the audit findings, the parties agree that a Team\nunder-reported 2023-24 BRI by one million dollars ($1,000,000), and that\nthe same error in the same amount occurred in 2022-23, then 2024-25 BRI\nwould be adjusted upward by two million dollars ($2,000,000).\n274\nArticle VII\n(e) Related Party Access. The Players Association’s Accountants\nshall have access to such portions of a Related Party’s books and records\nthat the accountants have a well-founded basis to believe have a meaningful\nimpact on BRI. For purposes of the foregoing, (i) where a team plays in an\narena owned or operated by a Related Party, the Players Association’s\nAccountants will have access to that Related Party arena company’s trial\nbalance relating to all revenues and to such other portions of the trial balance\nthat the Players Association’s Accountants have a well-founded basis to\nbelieve have a meaningful impact on BRI; (ii) for other Related Parties,\ninformation requests should fit the circumstances to enable the Players\nAssociation’s Accountants to verify the accuracy of BRI amounts (x) that\ncannot reasonably be verified through other means, and (y) without\naccessing financial and business information that there is no well-founded\nbasis to believe have a meaningful impact on BRI; and (iii) the NBA, Players\nAssociation, and the Team will collectively consider any request for access\nto Related Party books and records while onsite and make their best efforts\nto resolve the access issue.\n(f) Bilateral Adjustments. Subject to the deadlines set forth in\nSection 11(g) below, the NBA may propose BRI adjustments with respect\nto any Team audited by the Players Association. The NBA’s right to\npropose such adjustments may not adversely affect in any way the time and\nresources available to the Players Association under its audit rights. In the\nevent that the Players Association disputes such proposed adjustments, such\nproposed adjustments shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in Article XXXII. The amount of any and all such proposed\nadjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the NBA in accordance\nwith this Section 11(f), including any adjustments made pursuant to\nSection 11(d) above, shall be deducted from BRI in the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich such resolution is reached.\n(g) Timing. Audits conducted by the Players Association must be\nnoticed within ninety (90) days after issuance of the final Audit Report in\nrespect of the applicable Salary Cap Year. Any proposed adjustments by the\nPlayers Association and NBA relating to Team audits (and in the case of the\nPlayers Association, with respect to any League Office audits) will be\nresolved by April 30 of the following calendar year. Each party will provide\nits proposed adjustments by March 25.\nArticle VII\n275\nSection 12. Designated Share Arrangement.\n(a) Definitions.

Any reduction to the Additional Benefit Amount\nfor a Salary Cap Year pursuant to this Section 12(b)(1) shall be\ndeducted from Total Benefits (and, thus, Adjusted Total Benefits)\nfor such Salary Cap Year (thus decreasing the Overage Amount\nand/or increasing the Shortfall Amount for such Salary Cap Year,\nas applicable).\n(2) For purposes of calculating Projected Benefits (and, thus, the\nSalary Cap) for a Salary Cap Year, no reduction expected to be made\npursuant to Section 12(b)(1) above shall be taken into account.\n(c) Compensation Adjustments.\n(1) For each Salary Cap Year, each Compensation payment made\nto a player in respect of the Season encompassed by such Salary Cap\nYear pursuant to an Adjustment Contract shall be adjusted by the\npercentage reduction that, when applied to each remaining\nCompensation payment in respect of that Season pursuant to such\nAdjustment Contract, and taking into account any Compensation\nadjustments already made pursuant to this Section 12(c), would\nresult in a reduction (pursuant to this Section 12(c)) of the total\nCompensation payable to such player pursuant to the Adjustment\nContract in respect of that Season equal to the then-applicable\nContract Reduction Amount.\nArticle VII\n281\n(2) In the event that, as of the completion of the Governing Audit\nReport, the Compensation payable to a player pursuant to the\nAdjustment Contract has already been reduced pursuant to this\nSection 12(c) by an amount that exceeds the then-applicable\nContract Reduction Amount, then such excess shall be paid to the\nplayer in equal installments over the remaining semi-monthly\npayment dates on which payments are due to such player for the\napplicable Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract beginning\nwith either the next semi-monthly payment date following the\nissuance of the Governing Audit Report or, if practicability warrants,\nthe second semi-monthly payment date following the issuance of the\nGoverning Audit Report (or, if there are no remaining payments due\nto such player for the applicable Season pursuant to the Adjustment\nContract, such excess shall be paid to the player within sixty (60)\ndays following the completion of the Governing Audit Report).\n(3) If for any reason, in respect of a Salary Cap Year, the Contract\nReduction Amount for an Adjustment Contract exceeds the amount\nby which the Compensation provided for by such Contract was\ndecreased pursuant to this Section 12(c) above, then the Players\nAssociation shall make good faith efforts to facilitate the applicable\nTeam’s recovery of such excess from the applicable player via a\ndirect payment. In the event any amount remains outstanding as of\nthe first semi-monthly payment date for the immediately following\nSalary Cap Year, such outstanding amount shall be subtracted from\nthe Contract Reduction Amount for such Adjustment Contract in\nrespect of the Salary Cap Year with respect to which such amount\nremains outstanding (and the parties shall adjust (or, if necessary,\ndeem amended) the Governing Audit Report to reflect such\ndecrease).\n(4) Within seven (7) days after receiving any set of Adjustment\nSchedules from the NBA, or within seven (7) days after any event\nthat the Players Association believes warrants a change in any\npreviously-issued Adjustment Schedules, the Players Association\nmay bring a proceeding before the System Arbitrator, in accordance\nwith Article XXXII, Section 10, contesting the NBA’s calculation of\nany player’s Compensation adjustment pursuant to this\nSection 12(c). Notwithstanding the commencement of any such\nproceeding, each Team shall continue making Compensation\n282\nArticle VII\nadjustments in accordance with this Section 12(c), and in no event\nshall any Team be prohibited from making such Compensation\nadjustments prior to a final determination in any such proceeding.\nIn the event that the NBA makes a determination, or a final\ndetermination is made in a proceeding in accordance with this\nSection 12(c)(4), that an adjustment to a player’s Compensation was\nerroneously calculated by the NBA, the sole remedy with respect to\nany amounts erroneously deducted from the player’s Compensation\nshall be to modify, as soon as practicable, the deduction amounts\napplicable to such player so as to reduce, in equal amounts, all\nscheduled future deductions from post-determination payments of\nCompensation until the amount of any prior over-deduction is fully\noffset; provided, however, that to the extent that reducing the\nplayer’s future deductions would not fully offset the prior\nover-deductions, the NBA shall instruct the applicable Team to pay\nthe player as soon as practicable such additional amounts as are\nnecessary to fully offset such over-deductions.\n(d) Team Overage Balance. In respect of each Salary Cap Year, each\nTeam’s Team Overage Balance shall (prior to any adjustments made in\naccordance with Section 12(e) below) equal:\n(1) If there is an Overage Amount that is less than or equal to ten\npercent (10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries: the Overage Amount\ndivided by thirty (30).\n(2) If there is an Overage Amount that is greater than ten percent\n(10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries: an amount equal to the sum of\n(i) ten percent (10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries divided by\nthirty (30), and (ii) the amount by which the Overage exceeds ten\npercent (10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries, multiplied by a fraction,\nthe numerator of which is the Team’s Adjusted Team Salary for such\nSalary Cap Year, and the denominator of which is Adjusted Total\nSalaries for such Salary Cap Year.\n(3) If the Overage Amount is zero (0): zero (0).\n(e) Allocation of Distribution Amount. Each Salary Cap Year, as part\nof the Governing Audit Report, the following processes will apply with\nArticle VII\n283\nrespect to Team Overage Balances and the Distribution Amount for such\nSalary Cap Year (the “Distribution Year”):\n(1) Beginning with the earliest Salary Cap Year in respect of which\nthe Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than zero (0):\n(i)\nIf the Distribution Year is later than such Salary Cap Year,\nthen each Team’s Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year shall be increased by an amount equal to its\nTeam Overage Balance in respect of such Salary Cap Year\nmultiplied by the Carryover Interest Rate in respect of the\nDistribution Year (and thus the Aggregate Team Overage\nBalance in respect of such Salary Cap Year shall be increased\nby the sum of the increase to each Team’s Team Overage\nBalance in accordance with this Section 12(e)(1)(i)); and\n(ii)\nWith respect to such Salary Cap Year, the Distribution\nAmount for the Distribution Year shall be allocated as\nfollows:\n(A)\nIf the Distribution Amount is greater than or equal\nto the Aggregate Team Overage Balance in respect\nof such Salary Cap Year, each Team shall be\nallocated a portion of the Distribution Amount\nequal to its Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year. As a result, each Team’s Team\nOverage Balance in respect of such Salary Cap Year\n(and thus the Aggregate Team Overage Balance in\nrespect of such Salary Cap Year) shall be reduced to\nzero (0); or\n(B)\nIf the Distribution Amount is less than the\nAggregate Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year, each Team shall be allocated a\nportion of the Distribution Amount in proportion\nto its Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year. As a result, each Team’s Team\nOverage Balance in respect of such Salary Cap Year\nshall be reduced by its respective allocated amount\n(and thus the Aggregate Team Overage Balance in\n284\nArticle VII\nrespect of such Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by\nthe sum of such allocated amounts).\n(2) The process described in Section 12(e)(1) above shall then be\nrepeated, in chronological order, for each successive Salary Cap Year\nfor which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than\nzero (0), utilizing the portion of the Distribution Amount for the\nDistribution Year that has not yet been allocated to Teams in respect\nof an earlier Salary Cap Year.\n(3) If, as a result of the existence of a Shortfall Amount for the\nDistribution Year and following the procedures described in\nSections 12(e)(1)-(2) above, the portion of the Distribution Amount\nthat has not been allocated to Teams is greater than zero (0), such\nunallocated portion of the Distribution Amount shall then be\nallocated to each player in proportion to the Adjustment Salary\nprovided for by his Adjustment Contract(s) (as a percentage of\nAdjusted Total Salaries) for the Distribution Year. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, if the portion of the Distribution Amount to be\nallocated to players pursuant to this Section 12(e)(3) in respect of the\nDistribution Year exceeds the Aggregate Reduction Amount in\nrespect of such Salary Cap Year, then such excess, rather than being\nallocated to each player in proportion to the Adjustment Salary\nprovided for by his Adjustment Contract(s), shall be allocated to\neach player on such proportional basis as may be reasonably\ndetermined by the Players Association.\nExample: Assume (i) as set forth in the Governing Audit Report for the 2024-25\nSalary Cap Year (i.e., the Distribution Year), the 2024-25 Distribution Amount is\n$500 million, and (ii) prior to any allocations of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount\npursuant to this Section 12(e), there is a 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance\nof $200 million and a 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $400 million,\nand (iii) the 2024-25 Carryover Interest Rate is five percent (5%).\nThe earliest Salary Cap Year in which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater\nthan zero (0) is the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year. Because the 2024-25 Distribution\nYear is later than the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, each Team’s 2023-24 Team\nOverage Balance (and hence the 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance) would\nbe increased by five percent (5%) (i.e., the 2024-25 Carryover Interest Rate). As a\nArticle VII\n285\nresult of such increase, the 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be $210\nmillion (i.e., $200 million increased by five percent (5%)).\nThe 2024-25 Distribution Amount of $500 million is greater than the 2023-24\nAggregate Team Overage Balance of $210 million. Accordingly, $210 million of the\n2024-25 Distribution Amount would be allocated to Teams in amounts equal to each\nTeam’s 2023-24 Team Overage Balance. As a result of such allocation, each Team’s\n2023-24 Team Overage Balance (and hence the 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage\nBalance) would be zero (0).\nThe next Salary Cap Year in which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater\nthan zero (0) is the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year. The Distribution Year is not later\nthan the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year and thus neither each Team’s 2024-25 Team\nOverage Balance nor the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be\nincreased pursuant to Section 12(e)(1)(i) above.\nThe unallocated portion of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount is $290 million ($500\nmillion less the $210 million amount that was allocated in respect of the 2023-24\nSalary Cap Year), which is less than the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance\nof $400 million. Accordingly, $290 million of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount\nwould be allocated to Teams in proportion to each Team’s 2024-25 Team Overage\nBalance. As a result of such allocation, each Team’s 2024-25 Team Overage Balance\nwould be decreased by its respective allocation of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount\n(and hence the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be reduced by $290\nmillion), resulting in a 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $110 million\n($400 million less the $290 million amount allocated from the 2024-25 Distribution\nAmount).\nIn accordance with Section 12(e)(3) above, no portion of the 2024-25 Distribution\nAmount would be allocated to players in respect of 2024-25 Adjustment Contracts.\n(f) Team Reconciliation Payments. The NBA shall facilitate the\nfollowing payments to be made within sixty (60) days following the\ncompletion of the Governing Audit Report in respect of each Salary Cap\nYear, based on the allocations described in Section 12(e) above. Each Team\nshall be entitled to receive or, if the result of the following calculation is\n286\nArticle VII\nnegative for such Team, required to pay, the following amount in respect of\na Salary Cap Year:\n(1) The sum of: (i) the total Distribution Amount allocated to the\nTeam in accordance with Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above; and (ii) the\nportion of the Distribution Amount allocated in accordance with\nSection 12(e)(3) above to each player in respect of an Adjustment\nContract for which the Team is (or was) the last Team responsible\nfor making payments to the player in respect of the Season\nencompassed by the Salary Cap Year for which the Governing Audit\nReport was just completed; less\n(2) The sum of: (i) the total amount by which such Team reduced\n(or is scheduled to reduce) Compensation payments to players in\nrespect of the Season encompassed by such Salary Cap Year\npursuant to Section 12(c) above; and (ii) the Shortfall Amount (if\nany) in respect of such Salary Cap Year divided by the number of\nTeams that played in the NBA during such Salary Cap Year.\n(g) Player Reconciliation Payments. Following completion of the\nGoverning Audit Report in respect of each Salary Cap Year, each player to\nwhom a portion of the Distribution Amount is allocated in accordance with\nSection 12(e)(3) above shall be paid the amount of such allocation in respect\nof an Adjustment Contract by the final Team responsible for making\npayments to such player pursuant to such Adjustment Contract in respect\nof the Salary Cap Year for which the Governing Audit Report was just\ncompleted. Such payment shall be made to the player in equal installments\nover the remaining semi-monthly dates on which payments are due to the\nplayer for the applicable Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract\nbeginning with either the next semi-monthly payment date following the\nissuance of the Governing Audit Report or, if practicability warrants, the\nsecond semi-monthly payment date following the issuance of the Governing\nAudit Report (or, if there are no remaining payments due to the player for\nsuch Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract, in one (1) payment to be\nmade within sixty (60) days following the completion of the Governing\nAudit Report).\n(h) Survival of Obligation and Terms. In the event that, upon the\nexpiration or termination of this Agreement, there is an Aggregate Team\nOverage Balance in respect of any Salary Cap Year (including the final Salary\nArticle VII\n287\nCap Year of this Agreement) that is greater than zero (0), the sum total of\nany Aggregate Team Overage Balances shall be due and owing by the players\nto the Teams and shall be recouped in full by the Teams under a successor\ncollective bargaining agreement via reductions to the Compensation\notherwise payable to players (i) no later than the Salary Cap Years in which\nsuch Aggregate Team Overage Balances would have been recouped\npursuant to this Section 12 had these provisions continued in effect, and\n(ii) using the method described in this Section 12 or such other method as\nis mutually agreed by the parties. Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Agreement, the terms of this Section 12(h) shall survive the expiration\nor termination of this Agreement. For clarity, nothing in this Section 12(h)\nshall impact any right to engage in any strikes, lockouts, or cessations or\nother stoppages of work following the expiration or termination of this\nAgreement.\n(i) Information to Be Included in Audit Report. The parties shall\ncause the Accountants to include in the Interim Audit Report and the\nGoverning Audit Report for each Salary Cap Year schedules setting forth,\nwith respect to such Salary Cap Year:\n(1) BRI, the Designated Share, Total Salaries and Benefits, and\nAdjusted Total Salaries and Benefits;\n(2) the Overage Amount or the Shortfall Amount (as applicable);\n(3) the Actual Reduction Percentage;\n(4) the Aggregate Reduction Amount;\n(5) the Distribution Amount;\n(6) the Aggregate Team Overage Balance and each Team’s Team\nOverage Balance, both before and after the application of\nSections 12(e)(1)-(2) above;\n(7) for each prior Salary Cap Year in respect of which the\nAggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than zero (0) prior to\nthe application of Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above, the Aggregate Team\nOverage Balance and each Team’s Team Overage Balance in respect\nof each such prior Salary Cap Year, both before and after the\napplication of Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above;\n288\nArticle VII\n(8) a listing of each Team and the Distribution Amount allocated\nto each such Team in accordance with Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above;\n(9) a listing of each Adjustment Contract, the associated Contract\nReduction Amount, and the Distribution Amount allocated to the\nplayer in respect of such Adjustment Contract in accordance with\nSection 12(e)(3) above;\n(10) a summary of the reconciliation payments described in\nSections 12(f)-(g) above;\n(11) the amount (if any) by which each Team’s Tax Team Salary (as\ncomputed pursuant to Section 2(d) above) exceeds the Tax Level,\nand the resulting tax payment due by the Team;\n(12) the amount (if any) of any Minimum Team Salary payment\nowed by a team in accordance with Section 2(c) above; and\n(13) the amount (if any) by which each Team’s Apron Team Salary\n(as computed pursuant to Section 2(e) above) exceeds the Second\nApron Level.\n(j)\nMiscellaneous.\n(1) For all purposes under this Agreement, the computation of a\nplayer’s Salary or Adjustment Salary shall be made without regard to\nany adjustment made (or to be made) to such player’s Compensation\nin accordance with this Section 12.\n(2) When (i) pursuant to Article VI, Section 1 or Article XLI,\nSection 4(e), a player has forfeited a portion of his Compensation\nfor a Season (payable to him pursuant to an Adjustment Contract)\n(the “forfeited amount”) and (ii) following the completion of the\nGoverning Audit Report, the Contract Reduction Amount for such\nAdjustment Contract for the applicable Salary Cap Year is greater\nthan zero (0), then the player shall be entitled to a refund of a portion\nof the forfeited amount. The refund shall be in an amount equal to\nthe Contract Reduction Amount for the Adjustment Contract for\nthe Salary Cap Year to which the forfeited amount related multiplied\nby a fraction, the numerator of which is the forfeited amount, and\nthe denominator of which is the player’s Base Compensation for\nArticle VII\n289\nsuch Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract as of the date(s)\nthe Compensation was forfeited. For clarity, the amount of the\nrefund shall be less all amounts required to be withheld by any\ngovernmental authority. For purposes of the foregoing calculation,\na player’s Contract Reduction Amount shall be deemed to include\nonly the portion of the player’s Contract Reduction Amount that\nrelates to the Base Compensation for the applicable Season set forth\nin the applicable Adjustment Contract. Such refund shall be made\nto the player within sixty (60) days following the completion of the\nGoverning Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year in which the\nforfeited amount is collected.\n290\nArticle VIII"
