The player shall furnish such written estimate to the Team within a\nreasonable time following the notice of the assignment of the Player\nContract. Upon receipt of such estimate from the player, the Team shall,\nwithin ten (10) days, either agree to reimburse the player for the expenses\nset forth in such estimate or make alternative arrangements (at the Team’s\nexpense) for the move of the player. “Reasonable” moving expenses shall\ninclude the cost of moving not more than one (1) automobile for the player\n(and not more than two (2) automobiles if the player is married).\n(b) Hotel Accommodations. A player whose Contract is assigned\nfrom one Team to another shall be reimbursed by the assignee Team for the\ncost of a hotel room in a hotel (comparable to that in which such Team’s\nplayers are lodged while “on the road”) in the assignee Team’s home city for\nup to forty-six (46) days following the assignment.\n(c) Housing Costs Reimbursement. A player whose Contract is\nassigned from one Team to another shall be reimbursed by the assignee\nTeam for the cost of his living quarters (either rent or mortgage expense) in\nthe city from which he is assigned, for a period of three months after the\ndate of the assignment; provided, however, that such payment shall: (i) be\nmade only if and to the extent that the player is legally obligated for such\n68\nArticle III\ncosts; and (ii) not exceed $6,000 per month.

Prior to reimbursing an assigned player as\nprovided in this Section, an assignee Team may require satisfactory proof\nthat the player has paid the amounts for which he seeks reimbursement, and,\nin the case of housing costs reimbursements, satisfactory proof that the\nplayer is legally obligated to pay such housing costs and the amount thereof.\nUpon notice to the player, the assignee Team may, as an alternative to\nreimbursement, pay the expenses incurred upon assignment (in accordance\nwith the foregoing provisions of this Section) directly to the persons, firms,\nor corporations involved.\n(e) Player Obligation to Minimize Potential Liability. So as to\nminimize the potential liability of NBA Teams under this Section, a player\nwho does not establish permanent or year-round residence in the home city\n(or geographic vicinity thereof) of the Team by which he is employed shall\nuse his best efforts (i) to obtain a short-term lease on the living quarters he\nselects, and (ii) to procure lease provisions authorizing him to sublet such\npremises and/or granting such Team the option to take over such lease in\nthe event the Contract of such player is assigned to another NBA Team.",

In the\nevent that any such contribution or portion thereof is not fully\ndeductible when paid, the NBA and the Players Association agree to\nbargain in good faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to\nbe provided by the NBA Teams to the players. The costs of any\nsuch alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as\ndetermined on an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams substantially\nequal to but no greater than the annual accrual cost that such Teams\nwould have incurred under the Pension Plan to fund the amount by\nwhich the New Monthly Benefit is reduced pursuant to this\nSection 1(d)(3). If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the\nPlayers Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative\narrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create\nany right: (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this\nAgreement any terms concerning the provision of pension benefits\nto the players; (B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.\n(e) Administration.\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.3(f) of the Pension Trust\nAgreement, which are hereby incorporated by reference and\nexpressly designed to survive the expiration or termination of this\nAgreement, the Pension Plan shall continue to be jointly operated\nand administered by the NBA and the Players Association in\naccordance with Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management\nRelations Act of 1947, as amended, and the provisions of the\nPension Trust Agreement and the Pension Plan.\n(2) It is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that:\n(i) the Pension Plan shall continue to constitute a\ncollectively-bargained multiemployer defined benefit pension plan\n74\nArticle IV\nthat is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; and (ii) the\nPension Plan’s corresponding Trust is exempt from taxation under\nthe provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code.\n(3) The daily operations of the Pension Plan shall continue to be\ndelegated to one or more independent third-party administrators, as\nselected by the Board of Trustees of the Pension Plan in its sole\ndiscretion.\n(f) Contributions/Funding.

For any period during the\nterm of this Agreement during which a new “funding improvement plan” (a\n“FIP”) is required to be adopted by the Pension Plan under the Minimum\nFunding Standards, the funding benchmark for such FIP shall equal the\nfunding benchmark required by the Minimum Funding Standards. The\nTeams may, in the sole discretion of the NBA, contribute to the Pension\nPlan more than the amount necessary to meet the Minimum Funding\nStandards; provided, however, that any such additional contribution amount\nshall not be greater than the contribution amount determined by the\nactuaries of the Pension Plan in accordance with the Pension Plan’s\nhistorical scheduled contribution methodology. All contributions shall be\nconditioned on their being fully deductible by the Teams when paid.\n(g) Players Employed by Toronto.\n(1) Players employed by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment\nPartnership (or any successor thereto) (“Toronto”) or by an NBA\nTeam located in any country other than the United States shall\ncontinue to receive pension benefits of comparable value.

In the event of such\ntermination, the NBA and Players Association agree to bargain in\ngood faith with respect to an alternative arrangement to be provided\nby Toronto to the Toronto Players. Any such alternative\narrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax\nbasis) to Toronto substantially equal to but no greater than the\nannual accrual cost that Toronto would have incurred under the\nPension Plan and the Toronto Plan. If despite good faith\nnegotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with\nrespect to an alternative arrangement as described above, such\nfailure to agree shall not create any right: (A) to unilaterally\nimplement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning\nthe provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to lockout; or\n(C) to strike.\n(3) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.1(a) of the Toronto Plan,\nwhich are hereby incorporated by reference and expressly designed\n76\nArticle IV\nto survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the\nToronto Plan shall continue to be jointly operated and administered\nby the NBA and Players Association in accordance with Section\n302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as\namended, Section 8(1)(b) of the Pension Benefits Act (as defined in\nthe Toronto Plan), and the provisions of the Toronto Plan.\n(4) It is intended by the NBA and the Players Association that:\n(i) the Toronto Plan shall continue to constitute a\ncollectively-bargained single employer defined benefit pension plan\nthat is sponsored by Toronto and is tax-qualified under\nSection 401(a) of the Code and registered under Section 147.1 of the\nIncome Tax Act (as defined in the Toronto Plan) and Sections 9 and\n12 of the Pension Benefits Act; and (ii) the Toronto Plan’s\ncorresponding trust fund shall continue to be exempt from taxation\nunder the provisions of Section 149(1)(o) of the Income Tax Act\nand Section 501(a) of the Code.\n(5) The daily operations of the Toronto Plan shall continue to be\ndelegated to one or more independent third-party administrators, as\nselected by the Committee of the Toronto Plan in its sole discretion.\n(h) Pension Plan Tax-Qualification Status.\nNotwithstanding\nanything else in this Agreement: (1) if any change or amendment made to\nthe Code, ERISA, or other applicable law, or to any regulations (whether\nfinal, temporary, or proposed) or rulings issued thereunder; (2) if any\ninterpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation,\napplication, or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the\nUnited States or by the IRS, of the Code, ERISA, or other applicable law,\nor any regulations or rulings issued thereunder; (3) if any regulations\n(whether final, temporary, or proposed) or rulings issued by the IRS under\nthe Code or ERISA; or (4) if any provisions of this Agreement, including,\nwithout limitation, any of the amendments or benefit increases to be\nprovided under the Pension Plan pursuant to this Section 1, would result in\nthe Pension Plan no longer being a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a)\nof the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above\nany costs required to be incurred to implement the provisions of this\nAgreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement in order for the\nPension Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under Section 401(a) of the\nCode (but only to the extent that such additional costs are incurred in\nArticle IV\n77\nconnection with the provision of pension benefits to their non-player\nemployees or to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of\nSections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation\nto continue to provide for the accrual of additional benefits under the\nPension Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective\nbargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such\ntermination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision\nof this Agreement or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other provision\nof any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right:\n(i) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms\nconcerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (ii) to lockout;\nor (iii) to strike. In the event of such termination, the NBA and Players\nAssociation agree to bargain in good faith with respect to an alternative\narrangement to be provided by the NBA Teams to the players. The costs\nof any such alternative arrangement shall be at an annual cost (as determined\non an after-tax basis) to the NBA Teams substantially equal to but no greater\nthan the annual accrual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the\nPension Plan to fund the benefit described in this Section 1, commencing\non the date of termination. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and\nthe Players Association fail to agree with respect to an alternative\narrangement as described above, such failure to agree shall not create any\nright: (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any\nterms concerning the provision of pension benefits to the players; (B) to\nlockout; or (C) to strike.\n(i) Additional Pension Benefits Costs. The NBA Teams shall pay\nall costs, including, without limitation, the cost of professional fees (e.g.,\nattorneys, accountants, actuaries, and consultants) (“Professional Fees”),\nincurred in connection with: (1) the operation and administration of the\nToronto Plan (but excluding the cost of contributions made by Toronto to\nthe Toronto Plan), and (2) the determination and implementation of any\nalternative benefits pursuant to Sections 1(g)(2) and/or 1(h).\n(j) Actuarial Determinations. All actuarial determinations that need\nto be made in connection with, or under, the Pension Plan, including,\nwithout limitation, those necessary to implement this Section 1 and Section\n9 below, shall be made by the actuaries of the Pension Plan.

The cost to Toronto of funding any alternative\narrangement(s) to any of the benefit(s) described in Section 3(a) shall be\nsubject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. If despite good faith\nnegotiations, the NBA and the Players Association fail to agree with respect\nto any alternative arrangement(s) as described above, such failure to agree\nshall not create any right (A) to unilaterally implement during the term of\nthis Agreement any terms concerning the provision of benefits provided or\nto be provided by the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan; (B) to lockout; or\n(C) to strike.\n(d) Deductibility of Contributions/Regulatory Changes.\n(1) The Health and Welfare Benefit Trust and the Health and\nWelfare Benefit Plan shall be operated and administered in a manner\nthat will result in all contributions by the Teams being fully\ndeductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian income\ntax laws) when paid to the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust (or\ndirectly to an insurance carrier for a benefit provided under the\nHealth and Welfare Benefit Plan). If any Team is disallowed a\ndeduction (in whole or in part) for such contributions, and unless\nthe NBA determines otherwise, the obligation to provide the benefit\n(or portion of the benefit under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan\nto which the contribution relates) and to make further contributions\nto provide the benefit (or portion of the benefit under the Health\nand Welfare Benefit Plan to which the contribution relates) shall\nimmediately terminate and the provisions of Section 3(d)(3) shall\napply.\n(2) In the event that any benefit under the Health and Welfare\nBenefit Plan is no longer permissible or available due to applicable\nlaws (a “Regulatory Change”), the obligation to provide the benefit\nshall immediately terminate and the provisions of Section 3(d)(3)\nshall apply.\n(3) Any termination of the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan or a\nbenefit under such plan pursuant to Sections 3(d)(1)-(2) shall not\nimpair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this\nAgreement, or the legally binding effect (if any) of any other\nprovision of any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it\ncreate any right (i) to unilaterally implement, during the term of this\nArticle IV\n87\nAgreement, any terms concerning the provision of the Health and\nWelfare Benefit Plan (or the applicable benefit provided or to be\nprovided); (ii) to lockout; or (iii) to strike. In the event of any\ntermination pursuant to Sections 3(d)(1)-(2) of the Health and\nWelfare Benefit Plan or a benefit under such plan, the NBA and\nPlayers Association agree to bargain in good faith with respect to\nalternative arrangement(s) to be provided by the NBA Teams to the\nplayers; provided, however, that any such alternative arrangement(s)\nshall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this\nAgreement, including, without limitation, with respect to an\nalternative arrangement to the Retiree Medical Plan, the terms and\nconditions set forth in Section 3(a)(5). The annual cost incurred by\nthe NBA Teams in connection with any such alternative\narrangement(s) (as determined on an after-tax basis) shall not exceed\nthe annual cost that such Teams would have incurred in providing\nthe relevant benefit(s) under the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan\ncommencing on the date of termination. Any such alternative\narrangement(s) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and\nthe Health and Welfare Benefit Plan, be funded by such monies as\nmay then remain in the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust and, if the\nmonies remaining in the Health and Welfare Benefit Trust may not\nlawfully be used for, or are insufficient for, such purpose, such\nalternative arrangement(s) shall be funded by the NBA Teams. Any\nsuch alternative arrangement(s) shall be operated and administered\nin a manner that will result in all contributions by the Teams being\nfully deductible under the Code (and, where applicable, Canadian\nincome tax laws) when paid. The costs of funding any alternative\narrangement(s) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this\nAgreement. If despite good faith negotiations, the NBA and the\nPlayers Association fail to agree with respect to any alternative\narrangement(s) as described above, such failure to agree shall not\ncreate any right: (A) to unilaterally implement, during the term of\nthis Agreement, any terms concerning the provision of benefits\nprovided or to be provided by the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan;\n(B) to lockout; or (C) to strike.\n(e) Additional Health and Welfare Benefits Costs. Except as\notherwise set forth in Section 9(b)(12), the NBA Teams shall pay all costs,\nincluding, without limitation, the cost of Professional Fees, incurred in\nconnection with (1) the operation and administration of the Health and\n88\nArticle IV\nWelfare Benefit Plan Trust and the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan\n(including, without limitation, the operation and administration of the\nbenefits set forth in Section 3(a) above and any other benefits to be provided\nunder the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan), and (2) the determination and\nimplementation of any alternative arrangement pursuant to Section 3(d)(3).\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentence, this Section 3(e) shall not apply to\nany costs or fees attributable to investment management fees in connection\nwith the investment of Health and Welfare Benefit Trust assets. Such costs\nand fees shall: (i) be paid out of the assets of the Health and Welfare Benefit\nTrust; and (ii) be excluded for purposes of all calculations called for under\nthis Agreement of, or relating to, Benefits (including, without limitation, for\npurposes of: (A) preparing the Audit Report, Interim Audit Report, or\nInterim Designated Share Audit Report; and (B) calculating Total Benefits,\nTotal Salaries and Benefits, and Projected Benefits).",

If the NBA does not prohibit or rescind the Team’s\ndiscipline, the Team may impose its proposed discipline or the Team’s\ndiscipline will remain in effect, as applicable, and, if the Team’s discipline\nbecomes effective or remains in effect, the NBA may not thereafter impose\ndiscipline on the player for that act or conduct.\n(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 10(a)\nor 10(b), (i) the same act or conduct by a player may result in both a\ntermination of the player’s Uniform Player Contract by his Team and the\nsuspension of the player by the NBA if the egregious nature of the act or\nconduct is so lacking in justification as to warrant such double penalty, and\n(ii) both the NBA and the Team to which a player is traded may impose\ndiscipline for a player’s failure to report for a trade in accordance with\nParagraph 10(d) of the Uniform Player Contract.\nSection 11. League Investigations.\n(a) Players are required to cooperate with investigations of alleged\nplayer misconduct conducted by the NBA. Failure to so cooperate, in the\nabsence of a reasonable apprehension of criminal prosecution, will subject\nthe player to reasonable fines and/or suspensions imposed by the NBA.\nAny investigations of alleged misconduct that is covered by the Joint\nNBA/NBPA Policy on Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child\nAbuse shall be governed by the terms of that Policy.\n(b) Except as set forth in Section 11(c) below, the NBA shall provide\nthe Players Association with such advance notice as is reasonable in the\ncircumstances of any interview or meeting to be held (in person or by\ntelephone) between an NBA representative and a player under investigation\n120\nArticle VI\nby the NBA for alleged misconduct, and shall invite a representative of the\nPlayers Association to participate or attend. The failure or inability of a\nPlayers Association representative to participate in or attend the interview\nor meeting, however, shall not prevent the interview or meeting from\nproceeding as scheduled. A willful disregard by the NBA of its obligation\nto notify the Players Association as provided for by this Section 11(b) shall\nbar the NBA from using as evidence against the player in a proceeding\ninvolving such alleged misconduct any statements made by the player in the\ninterview or meeting conducted by the NBA representative.\n(c) The provisions of Section 11(b) above shall not apply to interviews\nor meetings: (i) held by the NBA as part of an investigation with respect to\nalleged player misconduct that occurred at the site of a game; and (ii) which\ntake place during the course of, or immediately preceding or following, such\ngame. With respect to any such interview or meeting, the NBA’s only\nobligation shall be to provide notice to the Players Association that the NBA\nwill be conducting an investigation and holding an interview or meeting in\nconnection therewith. Such notice may be given by telephone at a telephone\nnumber or by email at an email address to be designated in writing by the\nPlayers Association.\nSection 12.

Notice to the player of a possible\nsuspension may be given by the NBA to the Players Association by\ntelephone at a telephone number or by email at an email address to be\ndesignated in writing by the Players Association. Notice by the player of his\nrequest for a meeting pursuant to this Section 12(c) may be provided\nthrough the Players Association on the player’s behalf, and a representative\nof the Players Association may participate in any such telephone call. The\nNBA will consider any information provided during the meeting before\nfinalizing its decision; provided, however, that nothing contained herein will\nrequire the NBA to alter its disciplinary decision or affect any rights the\nplayer has under Article XXXI to appeal that decision.\nSection 13. Off-Court Conduct.\nFollowing the imposition of discipline on a player by the NBA for\noff-court conduct, and upon request by the Players Association, the NBA\nshall identify for the Players Association the key evidence or other materials\nupon which the disciplinary decision was based. The foregoing obligation,\nincluding, but not limited to, the NBA’s provision of such information and\nthe extent or nature of the information provided, shall be without prejudice\n122\nArticle VI\nto the NBA, including by not limiting the evidence or other materials upon\nwhich the NBA may rely in any proceeding relating to the discipline\nimposed.\nSection 14.

After that mandatory evaluation, the Medical\nDirector may require the player to attend up to ten (10) substance abuse\ncounseling sessions.\n(b) No player shall use any Marijuana Product (defined below) while he\nis physically present at a facility or venue owned, operated, or being used by\na Team, the NBA, or any Team- or League-related entity. Any violation of\nthis Section 15(b) shall subject the player to discipline as is reasonable under\nthe circumstances. With respect to discipline imposed by the NBA and/or\nthe Team, the One Penalty rule set forth in Article VI, Section 10 of this\nAgreement shall apply.\nSection 16. Player Arrests.\nA Team shall not impose discipline on a player solely on the basis of the\nfact that the player has been arrested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a\nTeam may impose discipline on a player for the conduct underlying the\nArticle VI\n123\nplayer’s arrest if it has an independent basis for doing so, (b) nothing herein\nshall permit a Team to discipline a player for his failure to cooperate with a\nTeam’s investigation of his alleged misconduct if he has a reasonable\napprehension of criminal prosecution, and (c) nothing herein shall prevent\na Team from precluding a player from participating in Team activities\nwithout loss of pay to the extent it otherwise has the right to do so.\nSection 17.

For purposes\n132\nArticle VII\nof this definition of BRI: (x) “operating revenues” shall include, but\nnot be limited to, any type of revenue included in BRI for the\n1995-96 and 1996-97 Salary Cap Years (without regard to whether\nsuch type of revenue is received on a lump-sum, non-recurring or\nextraordinary basis, but subject to any specific rules set forth in this\nArticle VII relating to the recognition or amortization of such\namounts); and (y) “Player” means a person: who is under a Player\nContract to an NBA Team; who completed the playing services\ncalled for under a Player Contract with an NBA Team at the\nconclusion of the prior Season; or who was under a Player Contract\nwith an NBA Team during (but not at the conclusion of) the prior\nSeason, but only with respect to the period for which he was under\nsuch Contract.

For\nclarity, the foregoing exclusion will not apply to revenues\nfrom the business operations of the NBA basketball team\nthat are otherwise includable as BRI under other provisions\nof this Agreement, including, without limitation, revenues\nreceived from sales of Team game tickets, media rights,\nsponsorships, signage outside the arena (subject to the\nlimitations set forth in Section 1(a)(1)(vi) above), and arena\nplaza game-day sales of novelties and concessions (subject\nto the limitations set forth in Section 1(a)(1)(v) above);\n(xxii)\nWithout limitation to any other basis for non-inclusion in\nBRI, BRI shall not include the value, if any, of (A) goods or\nservices that are operationally necessary to the performance\nof a contract, including, without limitation, certain ticketing\nplatforms and tools (e.g., Pricemaster, Presence, Open\nDistribution,\nArchtics,\nTicketmaster\nMarketplace,\n148\nArticle VII\nTicketmaster AccountManager), (B) product discounts, or\n(C) waived fees;\n(xxiii) Value, if any, attributable to data received by an NBA-related\nentity (or the right to receive such data), whether or not the\nprovision of such data is pursuant to a contractual\nobligation, other than amounts that are included in BRI\npursuant to Section 1(a)(1)(xx) above; and\n(xxiv) Value, if any, from contractual provisions (including but not\nlimited to those previously identified by the Players\nAssociation in connection with prior BRI audits) that require\nNBA or Team marketing partners to utilize the marketing\nrights purchased from an NBA-related entity in sponsorship\ndeals.\n(3) The parties agree that (i) in determining whether a category or\nsource of revenue or proceeds constitutes BRI: (A) consideration\nshall be given to whether such category or source is more similar in\nkind or nature to the included categories and sources listed in\nSection 1(a)(1)(i) through (xx) above, on the one hand, or to the\nexcluded categories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(2)(i) through\n(xxiv) above, on the other; and (B) no inference may be drawn from\nthe fact that such category or source was not included in the\ncategories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(1)(i) through (xx) above,\nor the fact that such category or source was not included in the\ncategories and sources listed in Section 1(a)(2)(i) through (xxiv)\nabove; and (ii) in any proceeding involving a dispute over (A) the\nincludability or categorization of any revenue or expense item for\nBRI purposes; (B) the amount to be included in or deducted from\nBRI with respect to any revenue or expense item; or (C) the\naccounting methodology used by the Accountants in connection\nwith any audit of BRI, the parties may refer to the past practice of\nthe parties or the Accountants in connection with the Audit Reports\nfor any of the 1999-2000 through 2021-22 Salary Cap Years;\nprovided, however, that no reference may be made to the past\npractice of the parties or the Accountants with respect to any source\nor category of revenue or expense that was included on the “open\nissues” list prepared by the Accountants in connection with any of\nsuch Audit Reports; provided, further, that any such past practice\nArticle VII\n149\nshall be superseded to the extent changed or clarified by the terms\nof this Agreement. In addition, no reference may be made, with\nrespect to expenses related to the NBA’s non-international business,\nto the fact that such category of expenses falls within\nSection 1(a)(14) below, to argue for the inclusion or exclusion of\nexpenses related to the League’s non-international business.\n(4) The parties agree that, with respect to any lease entered into\nafter the date of this Agreement between a Team (or a Related Party)\nand an arena that is not a Related Party, the Accountants may\nattribute to the Team (or a Related Party) for purposes of computing\nBRI for a Salary Cap Year portions of arena revenues received by\nthe arena or its related entities that would be included in BRI if\nreceived by the Team (or a Related Party) to the following extent: in\nthe event of a renewal, extension or renegotiation of a lease between\nthe same parties, or a new lease entered into by a Team (or a Related\nParty) with an arena that is not a Related Party, the Team will be\ndeemed to receive in the first Salary Cap Year covered by the new\nlease or by the renewal, extension or renegotiation of the existing\nlease (as the case may be) the greater of (i) the amount of such\nrevenues that the Team or the Related Party in fact receives under\nthe lease or, (ii) if in the opinion of the Accountants, the Team\n(and/or the Related Party) is receiving substantially less than fair\nmarket value as determined by the Accountants (taking into account\nfactors such as the rent paid by the Team or the Related Party, the\nnumber and identity of other major tenants in the arena, market\nconditions, the extent to which arena revenues are used to fund\nconstruction or renovations of the arena, and comparable lease\narrangements in the NBA), an amount determined by the\nAccountants to constitute the fair market value of the revenues that\na tenant, in the same circumstances as the Team or Related Party,\nwould receive for such Salary Cap Year. In either of the preceding\ncases, the Accountants will also determine the amount to be\nincluded in BRI for Salary Cap Years beyond the first Salary Cap\nYear.\n(5) (i) In no event shall the same revenues be included in BRI,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result\nof changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose\nof this provision being to preclude the double-counting of\n150\nArticle VII\nrevenues, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap\nYears.\n(ii)\nIn no event shall the same expenses be deducted from BRI,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than once (including as a result\nof changes in accounting methods or practices), the purpose\nof this provision being to preclude the double-counting of\nexpenses, whether in the same or in multiple Salary Cap\nYears.\n(6) Subject to Section 11 below (Players Association Audit Rights):\n(i)\nWith respect to expenses incurred in connection with all\nproceeds coming within Section 1(a)(1)(v) above, all\nreported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be\nreasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be\nthe subject of the accounting procedures set forth in Section\n10 below.\n(ii)\nWith respect to expenses incurred in connection with all\nproceeds coming within Section 1(a)(1)(ix) above that are\nconsistent with the types and categories of expenses incurred\nby Properties as reflected in the audited financial reports of\nProperties for the year ended July 31, 1994, (1) all such\nreported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be\nreasonable and customary, and such expenses shall not be\nthe subject of the accounting procedures set forth in Section\n10 below, but (2) such expenses shall be disallowed to the\nextent they exceed the ratio of expenses to revenues for the\ncategory of revenues set forth in Exhibit D hereto.\n(iii)\nWith respect to the NBA Store (the “Store”) and any other\nnew venture or business (whether or not involving the\ncreation of a new entity) undertaken by the NBA, Properties,\nMedia Ventures, or any other League-related entity requiring\nsignificant capital investment or start-up costs (“New\nVenture”), the League-related entities shall be able to deduct\nfrom BRI reasonable and customary expenses related\nthereto, including, but not limited to, cost of goods sold,\nsales tax, all reasonable operating expenses of the Store or\nArticle VII\n151\nNew Venture (including, but not limited to, salaries and\nbenefits directly related to the operations of the Store or\nNew Venture, promotional and advertising costs, rent, direct\noverhead, general and administrative expenses of the Store\nor New Venture), reasonable financing costs and\namortization of capital improvements and start-up costs;\nprovided, however, that in no event shall the expenses\nattributable to the Store or New Venture cause the amount\nincluded in BRI for the Store or New Venture to be less than\nzero (0) for any Salary Cap Year.\n(iv)\nWith respect to miscellaneous BRI or new categories of BRI\n(other than revenues attributable to the Store or a New\nVenture), the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, other\nLeague-related entities, Teams and Related Parties shall be\nable to deduct all reasonable and customary expenses\n(including reasonable and customary Taxes), including, for\nexample, in connection with All-Star Weekend, subject to\nthe terms of this Section 1(a)(6).\n(v)\nIn each Salary Cap Year, except for (A) Team Content\nRevenues and Team Content Expenses (as defined below)\nand (B) Playoff-Related Revenues and Expenses (as defined\nbelow), all Team and Related Party revenues included in, and\nall Team and Related Party expenses deducted from, BRI are\nsubject to an aggregate uniform percentage-of-revenues\nexpense cap of eleven and one-tenth percent (11.1%) (see\nalso Exhibit D hereto), with any such expenses disallowed\nto the extent they exceed that cap. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, for the 2021-22 Salary Cap Year, the total Team and\nRelated Party revenues and expenses that would have been\nsubject to the new eleven and one-tenth percent (11.1%)\nexpense cap were the amounts identified in the parties’ letter\nagreement, dated June 28, 2023. For the purposes of this\nArticle VII, Section 1, (1) “Team Content Revenues” and\n“Team Content Expenses” mean, respectively, revenues and\nrelated expenses from local TV, cable, and Team direct-toconsumer media and (2) “Playoff-Related Revenues and\nExpenses” means the revenues and expenses reported in the\n“playoff gate receipts, net” amount shown in the Audit\n152\nArticle VII\nReport for the 2015-16 Salary Cap Year. Team Content\nRevenues, Team Content Expenses, and Playoff-Related\nRevenues and Expenses are not subject to the above\nuniform expense cap. Team Content Expenses will be\ndeductible and uncapped, and will include, without\nlimitation those expenses identified in the parties’ letter\nagreement, dated June 28, 2023. Playoff-related expenses\nwill continue to be deductible in accordance with the terms\nof the 2011 CBA as reflected in the Audit Report for the\n2015-16 Salary Cap Year. For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes\nwill be deducted from revenues included in BRI under\nSections 1(a)(1)(i), (iii), (vi), (vii), (viii), (x), (xi), (xiii), (xiv),\n(xviii), and (xix) (to the extent set forth in those subsections)\nbefore the application of the eleven and one-tenth percent\n(11.1%) ratio in calculating the uniform expense cap, and\nbefore the deduction of expenses.\n(vi)\nTo the extent that, for a Salary Cap Year, total Team Content\nExpenses and League Content Expenses (inclusive of\nNBAE and ITV expenses after application of caps) exceeds\nthe product of Team Content Revenues and League Content\nRevenues (inclusive of NBAE and ITV revenues) multiplied\nby the Rollover Ratio (as defined below), that excess would\nbe amortized over such Salary Cap Year and the next two\nSalary Cap Years. The “Rollover Ratio” shall be eighteen\nand one-half percent (18.5%), except that, beginning in the\n2026-27 Salary Cap Year, the Rollover Ratio shall be the\nhigher of (A) eighteen and one-half percent (18.5%) or\n(B) the highest actual ratio of Team Content Expenses and\nLeague Content Expenses to Team Content Revenues and\nLeague Content Revenues in any of the preceding Salary Cap\nYears under the CBA. Any amortized amount would be\nexcluded from each Salary Cap Year’s rollover threshold\ncalculation. An imputed interest rate equal to the 1-month\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.225% (calculated\nas of the July 1 of the Salary Cap Year during which such\ninterest accrues) will be applied on amortized amounts and\nrecouped in each Salary Cap Year in which amounts are\namortized. For the purposes of this Article VII, Section 1,\n“League Content Revenues” and “League Content\nArticle VII\n153\nExpenses” mean, respectively, revenues and expenses\nrelated to all NBA and League-related content categories of\nBRI, including Digital, International League Pass (DBS),\nNBAE, ITV, Media Ventures, Radio, and National TV. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, League Content Expenses will\nremain deductible and, with the exception of NBAE and\nITV, uncapped.\nFor example, if, in the 2025-26 Salary Cap Year, the sum of\nTeam Content Revenues and League Content Revenues\nwere $5 billion, and the sum of Team Content Expenses and\nLeague Content Expenses (after application of caps on\nNBAE and ITV expenses) were $1 billion, and the imputed\ninterest rate calculated pursuant to this Section 1(a)(6)(vi)\nwere four percent (4%), then the amortized amount would\nbe $75 million (i.e., $1 billion – $925 million (i.e., 18.5% of\n$5 billion)). $25 million of the amortized amount would be\ndeducted from BRI in the 2025-26 Salary Cap Year. In the\n2026-27 Salary Cap Year, the amortized amount to be\ndeducted from BRI in respect of the 2025-26 Salary Cap\nYear would be $26 million (i.e., $25 million, grown at four\npercent (4%) interest per Salary Cap Year for one Salary Cap\nYear). In the 2027-28 Salary Cap Year, the amortized\namount to be deducted from BRI in respect of the 2025-26\nSalary Cap Year would be $27.04 million (i.e., $25 million,\ngrown at four percent (4%) interest per Salary Cap Year for\ntwo Salary Cap Years).\n(7) It is acknowledged by the parties hereto that for purposes of\ndetermining BRI:\n(i)\nSome NBA Teams have engaged or may engage in\ntransactions with third parties that control, or own at least\nfifty percent (50%) of, the NBA Team or that are controlled\nor owned at least fifty percent (50%) by the persons or\nentities controlling or owning at least fifty percent (50%) of\nthe NBA Team (such third parties are referred to in this\nAgreement as a “Related Party”), and Related Parties\nthemselves engage in transactions with third parties that may\nresult in a Related Party’s receipt of revenues that constitute\n154\nArticle VII\nBRI. (Any entity that was an “entity related to an NBA\nteam” as defined by Article VII, Section 1(a)(4)(i) of the\nSeptember 18, 1995 Collective Bargaining Agreement\nbetween the NBA and the Players Association (the “1995\nCBA”) shall be deemed a Related Party under this\nAgreement for so long as such entity continues to be an\nentity related to an NBA Team within the meaning of the\n1995 CBA.) As provided in Section 1(a)(1) above, the\nrelevant proceeds received by any Related Party that come\nwithin such subsection and that relate to such Related Party’s\nTeam shall be included in BRI. However, except in\nconnection with telecast agreements (which are subject to\nSection 1(a)(7)(ii) below), with respect to any such revenues\nor proceeds retained or received by a Related Party (other\nthan arena revenues that relate to such Related Party’s Team\nincluding, but not limited to, in-arena sales of novelties and\nconcessions, NBA game parking, arena club revenues, suite\nand seat revenues and fixed and temporary in-arena signage,\nwhich shall be included in BRI as if received by the Team),\nor by a Team pursuant to a transaction with a Related Party,\nsuch revenues or proceeds shall be included in BRI only to\nthe extent that the NBA and the Players Association agree\nor, if they fail to agree, the Accountants shall reasonably\ndetermine the amount, if any, of such revenues or proceeds\nto attribute to the Team (taking into account factors such as\nthe nature of the transaction, arrangement and/or\nrelationship between the Team and the Related Party or\nbetween the Related Party and a third party, any amounts\nincluded in BRI with respect to other Teams (or Related\nParties) that have entered into comparable transactions,\narrangements and/or relationships with third parties, market\nconditions, the nature of any services or activities performed\nby the Related Party for, or in connection with, the\ngeneration of revenues or proceeds and the amount of\nrevenues or proceeds that the Related Party would be\nexpected to retain or receive with respect to comparable\ntransactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third\nparties), and the amount so attributed shall be the only\namount included in BRI. To the extent that the amount of\nsuch proceeds to be included in BRI cannot reasonably be\nArticle VII\n155\ndetermined with respect to any particular transaction, the\nAccountants shall determine a reasonable amount with\nrespect to such transaction, which shall be included in BRI.\n(In the event the Accountants refuse to make any such\ndetermination, such determination shall be made by a jointly\nselected expert with respect to any such transaction.)\nWithout limiting the foregoing, in no event shall BRI include\nconsideration paid to a Related Party in connection with\nrights acquired by such Related Party from a Team for fair\nmarket value, even if such consideration relates to NBA\ngames or NBA-related activities (including, by way of\nexample and not limitation, advertising revenue or\nsubscriber fees earned by a Related Party television network\nthat relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of NBA\ngames licensed to the television network by a Team).\n(ii)\nIn the event that, following the execution of this Agreement,\na Team (other than the New York Knicks (“Knicks”)) enters\ninto a local or regional telecast agreement with a Related\nParty, a copy of such agreement shall be provided to the\nPlayers Association within ten (10) days of approval of such\nagreement by the NBA. The Players Association and the\nNBA shall each have the right, not later than ten (10) days\nfollowing the date on which the Players Association receives\na copy of such agreement, to submit such agreement to a\njointly-selected television valuation expert or (in the absence\nof such agreement) determined in accordance with the\nprocedure set forth in this subsection (“TV Expert”) for the\nlimited purpose set forth in this Section 1(a)(7)(ii). In the\nevent that a party has so elected to submit such agreement\nto a TV Expert and the parties have not jointly selected a TV\nExpert within twenty (20) days following the date on which\nthe Players Association receives a copy of such agreement,\neach party shall appoint its own television valuation designee\nand the two designees so appointed shall within ten (10) days\nof their appointment, jointly select a third party to serve as\nthe TV Expert. Such TV Expert shall review such\nagreement to determine if the aggregate amount to be paid\nto the Team by the Related Party for the rights to telecast\nthe Team’s games pursuant to such agreement is more than\n156\nArticle VII\nfifteen percent (15%) above or more than fifteen percent\n(15%) below the fair market value of such rights over the\nterm of such agreement. In making such determination, the\nTV Expert may take into account factors such as the nature\nof the transaction, arrangement and/or relationship between\nthe Team and the Related Party, any amounts included in\nBRI with respect to other Teams (or Related Parties) that\nhave entered into comparable transactions, arrangements\nand/or relationships with other programming licensors,\nmarket conditions, the nature of any services or activities\nperformed by the Related Party for, or in connection with,\nthe generation of revenues or proceeds and the amount of\nrevenues or proceeds that the Related Party would be\nexpected to retain or receive with respect to comparable\ntransactions, arrangements and/or relationships with third\nparties; provided that in no event shall BRI include\nconsideration paid to a Related Party in connection with\nrights acquired by such Related Party from a Team for fair\nmarket value, even if such consideration relates to NBA\ngames or NBA-related activities (including, by way of\nexample and not limitation, advertising revenue or\nsubscriber fees earned by a Related Party television network\nthat relate, directly or indirectly, to the telecast of NBA\ngames licensed to the television network by a Team). In the\nevent that the TV Expert determines that such aggregate\namount is more than fifteen percent (15%) above or below\nfair market value, the TV Expert shall be instructed to\nsubmit to the parties the amount for each Season of such\nagreement that he determines reflects the fair market value\nof such rights and such amounts, and no other amounts,\nshall be included in BRI with respect to such agreement for\neach Salary Cap Year covered by such agreement. Any\ndetermination made by the TV Expert pursuant to either of\nthe preceding two sentences shall be submitted to the parties\nno later than twenty (20) days from the date on which such\nagreement was submitted to the TV Expert for his review.\nAny fees or costs associated with the retention or\ndetermination of the TV Expert shall be borne equally by\nthe Players Association and NBA. The Players Association\nand the TV Expert shall maintain the confidentiality of any\nArticle VII\n157\nsuch agreement (and any determination made by the TV\nexpert in accordance with this Section 1(a)(7)(ii)) pursuant\nto the terms of Section 11(c) below relating to the\nconfidentiality of BRI Audits.\n(iii)\nWith respect to the transactions listed below in this\nSection 1(a)(7)(iii), the parties agree that, because the\nproceeds attributable to these transactions cannot be\naccurately ascertained, the following procedures shall be\nused for each NBA Season in which MSG Network is a\nRelated Party of the Knicks (in the case of\nSection 1(a)(7)(iii)(A) below) and the Madison Square\nGarden arena is a Related Party of the Knicks (in the case of\nSection 1(a)(7)(iii)(B) below):\n(A)\nNew York Knicks transaction with MSG Network\nregarding the sale of local media rights: BRI for the\nKnicks for each NBA Season covered by this\nAgreement shall include an amount equal to the net\nproceeds included in BRI attributable to the Los\nAngeles Lakers’ sale, license or other conveyance of\nall local media rights (including, but not limited to,\nbroadcast and cable television and radio) for such\nNBA season.\n(B)\nNew York Knicks transactions with Related Parties\ninvolving signage: BRI for the Knicks for the\n2021-22 NBA Season shall include $16,560,026 for\nsignage. In each subsequent Season covered by this\nAgreement, this amount shall be increased (or\ndecreased, as the case may be) by the League-wide\npercentage increase (or decrease) in signage as\ndetermined in accordance with Sections 1(a)(1)(v)\nand (a)(1)(vi) above.\nAt such time as the MSG Network and/or the\nMadison Square Garden Arena are no longer Related\nParties, BRI for the New York Knicks in the\ncategories described in Section 1(a)(7)(iii)(A) and/or\n(B) above, as the case may be, shall not be\n158\nArticle VII\ndetermined in accordance with the foregoing and\nwill instead be determined by the applicable\nprovisions of Sections 1(a)(1) and (a)(7)(ii) above.\n(8) In the event that, pursuant to the NBA’s national broadcast,\nnational telecast and network cable television agreements, NBA\nTeams receive revenue sharing proceeds that are attributable to\nNBA game telecasts in more than one Salary Cap Year, such\nproceeds shall be allocated over the same number of Salary Cap\nYears (beginning with first Salary Cap Year after the Salary Cap Year\nin which such proceeds are actually received) as the number of Salary\nCap Years in which such games were televised. Any other\ncontingent payments received by the NBA pursuant to such\nagreements shall be included in BRI to the extent and in a manner\nagreed upon by the parties, or, if the parties cannot agree, in a\nreasonable manner determined by the Accountants.\n(9) The NBA and each NBA Team shall in good faith act and use\ntheir commercially reasonable efforts to increase BRI for each Salary\nCap Year during the term of this Agreement. In the exercise of such\ncommercially reasonable efforts, the NBA and each NBA Team\nshall be entitled to act in a manner consistent with their reasonable\nbusiness judgment and shall not (i) take any action intended to\nbenefit, at the expense of BRI, other commercial activities (such as\nthe WNBA and the NBAGL) unrelated to the performance of\nPlayers in NBA basketball games or in NBA-related activities, or\n(ii) shift or forgo revenues attributable to Salary Cap Years during\nthe term of this Agreement in exchange for revenues or benefits\nduring Salary Cap Years following the expiration of this Agreement\n(unless there is a reasonable business justification unrelated to\ncollective bargaining for such shift or forgoing). There shall be no\nobligation on the part of the NBA or any NBA Team to accelerate\ninto Salary Cap Years within the term of this Agreement revenues\nattributable to Salary Cap Years following the expiration of this\nAgreement. In evaluating compliance with this subsection, the\nparties and the System Arbitrator shall consider and give substantial\nweight to the reasonable business judgment of the NBA or the NBA\nTeam but no deference will be applied where the NBA is alleged to\nhave shifted or forgone revenues of $350 million or more for the\npurpose of securing leverage in collective bargaining, in which case\nArticle VII\n159\nany finding of non-compliance shall require proof by a clear\npreponderance of the evidence. The following is a list of decisions\nin respect of which the business judgment of the NBA or an NBA\nTeam shall conclusively be deemed reasonable: membership\nlocation; arena capacity or configuration; number and location of\ngames played; whether to outsource or operate a line of business;\nand whether to accept or decline a sponsorship, advertising or\nnaming rights opportunity. The foregoing list shall not limit in any\nmanner the circumstances in which the business judgment of the\nNBA or an NBA Team may be deemed reasonable.\n(10) The parties agree that upon a finding by the System Arbitrator\n(which, if appealed, is affirmed by the Appeals Panel) that the NBA\nor an NBA Team (or a Related Party) has willfully failed to provide\nto the Accountants information concerning revenues or expenses\nmaterial to the Accountants’ preparation of an Audit Report, and\nthat such failure to provide information resulted in an\nunderstatement of BRI of more than $5,511,614 with respect to the\n2023-24 Salary Cap Year (increasing by four and one-half percent\n(4.5%) for each subsequent Salary Cap Year of this Agreement,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year), then the amount by\nwhich BRI was understated shall be included in BRI in the Salary\nCap Year in which such finding is made, with interest accruing from\nthe date of the Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year in which such\namount would have been included but for such understatement,\nwith interest (at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as\npublished in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the issuance of\nsuch Audit Report). In addition, if any Team, or if the NBA, violates\nthe foregoing, it shall be fined $3 million for its first violation during\nthe term of this Agreement and an additional $1.5 million for each\nadditional violation.

The NBA and\nLeague-related entities may deduct from BRI expenses related to the\ndevelopment and operation of the League’s international business\n(“Newly-Deductible International Expenses”), subject to a limit of\nten percent (10%) of the League’s gross BRI international revenues\n(the allowed amount of such expense following application of the\nten percent (10%) cap being the “Allowed Newly-Deductible\nInternational Expenses”).\nNewly-Deductible International\nExpenses for any Salary Cap Year shall include all such international\nexpenses incurred at the League level that are not otherwise\ndeductible under this Agreement (excluding expenses in\ncurrently-deductible categories that are in excess of applicable\npercentage-of-revenue expense caps and the write-down of equity\ninvestments). For the purposes of this Agreement, the League’s\ngross BRI international revenue and Newly-Deductible\nInternational Expenses for the 2021-22 Salary Cap Year were the\namounts set forth in the parties’ letter agreement dated\nJune 28, 2023.\n(15) Miscellaneous BRI Accounting Rules.\n(i)\nTeam charter travel expenses for Regular Season games,\nassociated with broadcast and other personnel for whom\nsuch travel expenses are otherwise deductible (for example,\n164\nArticle VII\nwithout limitation on any other example, Team personnel\ntraveling in connection with the sale of Team sponsorships),\nshall be deductible at fifty percent (50%).\n(ii)\nBRI for premium seating, in respect of: (A) bunker, super,\nand party suites, (B) theatre boxes, loge boxes, and other\nsuch non-traditional premium seating inventory, and\n(C) traditional club seats, shall be calculated by using the\nparties’ previously-agreed upon methods, as reflected in the\nAudit Report for the 2015-16 Salary Cap Year.\n(iii)\nTo the extent salary paid to a person who also owns an\ninterest in the Team would otherwise be deductible from\nBRI, such salary shall only be deductible for BRI purposes\nonly if all of the following criteria are met and if the expense\notherwise qualifies for such deduction (for example, without\nlimitation, the salary is related to the BRI against which it is\ndeducted): (A) the owner owns less than seven and one-half\npercent (7.5%) of the Team; (B) the job being performed by\nthe owner would otherwise be performed by a non-owner\nstaff member; (C) the job being performed by the owner is\nhis/her full time job and he/she has no other roles with\noutside companies (with the exception of limited duty Board\nroles); (D) the salary being earned is reasonable and\ncustomary, relative to what a non-owner staff member\nwould earn, for the services being provided; and (E) there\nare no other individuals performing substantially the same\nrole employed by the Team where the role is such that\nordinarily there is only one person performing it (for\nexample, without limitation, Team president).\n(iv)\nWith respect to expenses associated with League-related\nentity advertising and public relations campaigns: (A) the\nexpenses will be allocated to BRI and non-BRI revenue\ncategories according to the methodology agreed to by the\nparties in connection with the final Audit Report for the\n2015-16 Salary Cap Year, except that such expenses shall\nalso be allocated to the NBA’s Regular Season gate\nassessment during the Salary Cap Year in addition to the\nother categories previously included in the allocation; and\nArticle VII\n165\n(B) the expenses shall be deducted from BRI, subject to\nSection 1(a)(6)(ii) above.\n(v)\nRevenues and expenses related to the new In-Season\nTournament (“IST”) shall be included in BRI as follows:\n(A) revenues and expenses from home-market Group Stage\ngames and IST Quarterfinals games not played in a neutral\nmarket will be treated as if earned or incurred during a\nRegular Season game; (B) notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in this Agreement, including, without limitation,\nArticle XX, Section 4(c), for purposes of Article VII,\nSection 1(a), revenues and expenses from neutral-market\ngames will be treated as league “Special Events,” subject to\nthe 100% expense cap for Special Events, except that, during\nthe 2023-24 and 2024-25 Salary Cap Years only, 50% of the\nexpenses related to any neutral-market IST game (other than\nthe IST Finals Game, and excluding any payments from the\nNBA to Teams described in the succeeding subpart) will be\ntreated as Team expenses subject to Section (1)(a)(6)(v)\nabove; and (C) payments from the NBA to Teams for\nparticipation in neutral-market IST games will be included in\nmiscellaneous BRI at the Team level, with the NBA\nrecording an expense relating to such payment at the League\nlevel in Special Events.\n(vi)\nBarter otherwise includable in BRI will not be excluded\nsolely on the basis that the bartered-for goods or services\nwere not used. For the avoidance of doubt, expenses\nassociated with the receipt and use of bartered goods or\nservices will be deductible from BRI subject to rules\napplicable to other expenses (e.g., that a barter expense is\ndeductible only where it relates to a category that allows for\ndeduction of expenses).\n(b) Accounting Methods/Lump Sum Payments.\n(1) Subject to Sections 1(b)(2) and (b)(3) below, and any provision\nhereof that expressly provides for an alternative accounting\ntreatment, BRI for each Salary Cap Year shall be calculated\nexclusively pursuant to the accrual method of financial accounting\n166\nArticle VII\n(and not, for any purpose, the cash method of financial accounting)\nand in accordance with United States Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles. By way of example, and not limitation, in\nthe event a team receives a signing bonus in consideration for its\nagreement to enter into a five (5) year contract for the local telecast\nof its games, such signing bonus shall be amortized in equal annual\namounts over the five (5) Salary Cap Years covered by such\ntelevision contract.\n(2) Except as otherwise provided in the case of luxury suites and\npremium seat licenses, in no event shall the amortization period for\nany lump sum payment exceed seven (7) years.\n(3) Any payments that constitute BRI and that are subject to being\nrepaid to the payor under certain circumstances (the\n“Contingencies”) shall constitute BRI in the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich such payments would have been earned but for the\nContingencies unless, at the time of such payments, the\nContingencies under which the payments would be repaid are likely\nto occur, in which case the payments will not be included in BRI\nunless and until such time as the Contingencies under which such\nrepayments would be made do not occur or are not likely to occur.\nIn the event that a payment that has been included in BRI is\nsubsequently repaid, BRI shall be reduced by the amount of such\nrepayment in the Salary Cap Year in which such repayment is made.\nIn any proceeding commenced before the System Arbitrator relating\nto the terms of this Section 1(b)(3), the NBA will bear the burden of\ndemonstrating that the applicable Contingencies are likely to occur.\n(4) With respect to lump sum payments (e.g., signing bonuses) that\nconstitute BRI and are received by a Team or Related Party under\nagreements entered into by a Team or Related Party, for the period,\nif any, between (x) the date when the lump sum payment is received\nand (y) the beginning of the Salary Cap Year when the amortization\nperiod for the lump sum payment begins pursuant to Section 1(b)(1)\nabove, BRI shall include in each applicable Salary Cap Year during\nthis period imputed interest on the amount of such lump sum\npayment at a rate equal to the one (1) year Treasury Bill rate as\npublished in The Wall Street Journal on the date the payment was\nreceived; provided, however, that such imputed interest shall only\nArticle VII\n167\nbe calculated and included in BRI if each of the following is satisfied:\n(i) the lump sum payment received by the Team or Related Party is\nin the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more; (ii) the\nlump sum payment is received by the Team or Related Party at least\ntwelve (12) months before the start of the Salary Cap Year in which\nit will first be included in BRI under Section 1(b)(1) above; and (iii)\nthe lump sum payment is not related to a ticket, luxury suite or seat\nlicensing transaction including, without limitation, revenues\nincluded in BRI under Sections 1(a)(1)(i), 1(a)(1)(vii), and 1(a)(1)(x)\nabove.\n(5) Loan proceeds from contractual counterparties that would be\nincluded in BRI if received as payment (rather than a loan) will be\nincluded in BRI if there is no realistic expectation of repayment,\nsubject to application of the lump sum amortization rules in this\nSection 1(b) and allocations for multi-element deals. If amounts in\nrespect of such a loan are included in BRI, but the loan is\nsubsequently repaid, BRI shall be reduced by the amount of such\nrepayment in the Salary Cap Year in which such repayment is made.\n(c) “Projected BRI” for a Salary Cap Year means the amount\ndetermined as follows: Prior to the start of each Salary Cap Year, the NBA\nand the Players Association shall meet for the purpose of agreeing upon\nProjected BRI for that Salary Cap Year. In the absence of an agreement of\nthe parties otherwise on or prior to the last day of the Moratorium Period\nof the applicable Salary Cap Year, Projected BRI for such Salary Cap Year\nshall be the sum of amounts determined in accordance with the following:\n(1) With respect to BRI sources other than national broadcast,\nnational telecast or network cable television contracts, Projected\nBRI shall include BRI for the preceding Salary Cap Year, increased\nby four and one-half percent (4.5%). For purposes of this\nSection 1(c)(1), a contract between or among any League-related\nentities and/or Teams shall not be considered national broadcast,\nnational telecast or network cable television contracts.\n(2) With respect to national broadcast, national telecast or network\ncable television contracts including the NBA/ABC agreement dated\nOctober 3, 2014 (“NBA/ABC Agreement”) (a copy of which has\nbeen provided to the Players Association) and the NBA/TBS\n168\nArticle VII\nagreement, dated October 3, 2014 (“NBA/TBS Agreement”) (a\ncopy of which has been provided to the Players Association), and\nnational broadcast, national telecast or network cable television\ncontracts covering Seasons that succeed the Seasons covered by the\nNBA/ABC and NBA/TBS Agreements (“Successor Agreements”)\n(copies of which shall be provided to the Players Association within\nten (10) days of execution), Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year shall\ninclude (i) the rights fees or other non-contingent payments stated\nin such contracts with respect to the Season covered by such Salary\nCap Year (as such rights fees or non-contingent payments may be\nadjusted by agreement of the parties to such contracts); (ii) the\namounts of revenue sharing proceeds, if any, that are includable in\nBRI for such Salary Cap Year pursuant to Section 1(a)(8) above;\n(iii) the amounts with respect to contingent payments (other than\nrevenue sharing proceeds), if any, attributable to Salary Cap Years\ncovered by this Agreement in Successor Agreements as such\namounts are agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties do not reach\nagreement, by the Accountants; and (iv) the amount included in BRI\nfor the preceding Salary Cap Year with respect to the value of\nadvertising or promotional time provided to the NBA as part of the\nNBA/ABC and NBA/TBS Agreements (or any Successor\nAgreements) that is used for any purpose other than those listed in\nSections 1(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(D).\n(3) In no event shall the same amounts be included in Projected\nBRI or Interim Projected BRI, directly or indirectly, more than once\n(including in the event that the terms of any Successor Agreements\nwould cause the same amounts to be indirectly included in Projected\nBRI or Interim Projected BRI for a Salary Cap Year pursuant to\nboth subsections (1) and (2) above), the purpose of this provision\nbeing to preclude the double-counting of amounts in the calculation\nof Projected BRI or Interim Projected BRI, whether in the same or\nin multiple Salary Cap Years.\n(d) “Local Expansion Team BRI” means the BRI of the Expansion\nTeams during their first two (2) Seasons, but not including the Expansion\nTeams’ share of League-wide revenues that are otherwise included in BRI\n(including, but not limited to, their share of national television, cable, radio\nand other broadcast revenues).\nArticle VII\n169\n(e) “Projected Local Expansion Team BRI” means Local Expansion\nTeam BRI for the immediately preceding Season, increased by four and\none-half percent (4.5%).\n(f) “Interim Projected BRI” means a projection of BRI for a Salary Cap\nYear using Estimated BRI in place of BRI for the previous Salary Cap Year.\n(g) “Barter” means to trade by exchanging one commodity, service or\nother non-cash item for another.\n(h) “Estimated Total Benefits” means the estimate of Total Benefits for\na Salary Cap Year as set forth in the Interim Audit Report (as defined in\nSection 10(a) below) for such Salary Cap Year.\n(i) “Estimated Total Salaries” means the estimate of Total Salaries for\na Salary Cap Year as set forth in the Interim Audit Report for such Salary\nCap Year.\n(j) “Estimated Total Salaries and Benefits” means the sum of Estimated\nTotal Benefits and Estimated Total Salaries for a Salary Cap Year as set forth\nin the Interim Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.\n(k) “Estimated BRI” means the estimate of BRI for a Salary Cap Year\nas set forth in the Interim Audit Report for such Salary Cap Year.",

The result of this calculation is the amount\nof the reduction in each of the Salary Cap,\nMinimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron\nLevel, and Second Apron Level for such\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further steps\nare required.\nIf Projected BRI for the subsequent Salary Cap\nYear exceeds one hundred eight percent (108%) of\nBRI for the Salary Cap Year and the Overage\nAmount described above does not exceed nine\npercent (9%) of Total Salaries and Benefits, then\nproceed to Step 3.\nSTEP 3: Subtract one hundred eight percent (108%) of BRI\nfor the Salary Cap Year from Projected BRI for the\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year.\nSTEP 4: Multiply the result of Step 3 by fifty percent (50%).\nSTEP 5: Subtract the result of Step 4 from the result of\nStep 1. If the result of this step is less than\nzero (0), then no adjustments shall be made to the\nSalary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level,\nFirst Apron Level, or Second Apron Level for the\nsubsequent Salary Cap Year, and no further steps\nare required.\nSTEP 6: Divide the result of Step 5 by the number of\nTeams in the NBA during such subsequent Salary\nCap Year (other than Expansion Teams in their\nfirst two (2) Salary Cap Years in the NBA). The\nresult of this calculation is the amount of the\nreduction in each of the Salary Cap, Minimum\nTeam Salary, Tax Level, First Apron Level, and\nSecond Apron Level for such subsequent Salary\nCap Year.\nArticle VII\n175\nExample: Assume: (i) 2024-25 Total Salaries and Benefits is $5.5 billion, the\n2024-25 Designated Share is $5.1 billion, and the resulting 2024-25 Overage\nAmount is $400 million (which equals approximately 7.3% of Total Salaries\nand Benefits); (ii) 2025-26 Projected BRI is $10.5 billion, 2024-25 BRI is\n$10 billion, and thus 2025-26 Projected BRI exceeds 2024-25 BRI by 5%;\nand (iii) there are 30 Teams in the NBA in the 2025-26 Season. The 202526 Salary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron Level, and\nSecond Apron Level would each be reduced by $2,333,333 (i.e., $70 million\n(i.e., 2024-25 Overage Amount of $400 million less $330 million (i.e., 6% of\n2024-25 Total Salaries and Benefits) divided by 30 (i.e., the number of Teams\nin the NBA during the 2025-26 Season)).\nExample: Same assumptions as in the prior example, except assume 2025-26\nProjected BRI is $10.9 billion (instead of $10.5 billion), and thus 2025-26\nProjected BRI exceeds 2024-25 BRI by 9%.

For the purposes of this Section 2(c)(5), MTS Cap Hold\nTeam Salaries shall:\n(i)\ninclude any Incentive Compensation excluded from Salaries\nin accordance with Article VII, Section 3(d) but actually\nearned by players during such Salary Cap Year; and\n(ii)\nexclude all Incentive Compensation included in Salaries in\naccordance with Article VII, Section 3(d) but not actually\nearned by players during such Salary Cap Year.\n(6) Any payment due by a Team in respect of a Salary Cap Year\npursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(i) or 2(c)(5) above shall be made by the\nTeam to the NBA no later than ten (10) business days following the\ncompletion of the Governing Audit Report for such Salary Cap\nYear. The NBA shall then distribute any such payments equally to\nArticle VII\n179\neach Team within ten (10) business days following its receipt of such\npayments.\n(7) Notwithstanding Section 2(c)(2)(ii) above, for the 2023-24\nSalary Cap Year only, if (i) a Team’s MTS Payment Team Salary for\nthe 2023-24 Salary Cap Year is less than the Minimum Team Salary\nfor such Salary Cap Year, and (ii) such Team does not owe a Tax for\nsuch Salary Cap Year, then such Team shall be entitled to receive a\nfifty percent (50%) share of any tax amount that the NBA elects to\ndistribute to non-taxpaying Teams in respect of such Salary Cap\nYear pursuant to Section 2(d)(4)(i) below. For example, if there were\ntwenty-four (24) non-taxpaying Teams for the 2023-24 Salary Cap\nYear and one (1) of such Teams had a MTS Payment Team Salary\nfor such Salary Cap Year less than the Minimum Team Salary, then\nsuch Team, rather than receiving one-twenty-fourth (1/24th) of the\ntotal amount that the NBA elects to distribute to non-taxpaying\nTeams pursuant to Section 2(d)(4)(i) below, would instead receive a\nTax distribution amount equal to the total amount to be distributed\nto non-taxpaying Teams multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is one-half (0.5) and the denominator of which is twenty-three\nand one-half (0.5/23.5). Each of the other twenty-three (23)\nnon-taxpaying Teams for the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year would receive\na Tax distribution amount equal to the total amount to be distributed\nto non-taxpaying Teams multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is one (1) and the denominator of which is twenty-three and\none-half (1/23.5).\n(8) Nothing contained herein shall preclude a Team from having a\nTeam Salary in excess of the Minimum Team Salary, provided that\nthe Team’s Team Salary does not exceed the Salary Cap plus any\nadditional amounts authorized pursuant to the Exceptions set forth\nin this Article VII.\n(d) Operation of Tax Level.\n(1) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the\nfollowing meanings:\n(i)\n“Tax Team Salary” means, for a Team for a Salary Cap Year,\nthe Team’s Team Salary as of the start of its last Regular\n180\nArticle VII\nSeason game occurring within such Salary Cap Year,\ncalculated by the Accountants in the same manner as Team\nSalary is calculated by the Accountants for purposes of\ncomputing Total Salaries and Benefits in the Audit Report:\n(A)\nplus all Incentive Compensation excluded from\nSalary under Section 3(d) below but actually earned\nby the player during such Salary Cap Year;\n(B)\nminus all Incentive Compensation included in Salary\nunder Section 3(d) below but not actually earned by\nthe player during such Salary Cap Year;\n(C)\nplus, with respect to any trade that occurs following\nthe conclusion of the Team’s last Regular Season\ngame, the portion of any trade bonus earned by a\nplayer that is included in the Team’s Team Salary for\nsuch Salary Cap Year;\n(D)\nplus any amount that is added to the Team’s Team\nSalary for such Salary Cap Year following the start\nof the Team’s last Regular Season game pursuant to\nSection 4(a)(1)(iii) below;\n(E)\nminus fifty percent (50%) of any reduction made to\na player’s Compensation as a result of a suspension\nby the NBA (but not by a Team); and\n(F)\nplus, with respect to a Standard NBA Contract\nbetween a Team and a Free Agent with zero (0)\nYears of Service or one (1) Year of Service, the\namount (if any) by which (x) the Minimum Player\nSalary that would be applicable to a player with two\n(2) Years of Service as set forth in the Minimum\nAnnual Salary Scale for the Salary Cap Year in which\nsuch Free Agent was signed (or in the event such\nFree Agent’s Contract is terminated during the\nRegular Season, the Minimum Player Salary that\nwould be applicable to a player with two (2) Years of\nService as set forth in the Minimum Annual Salary\nArticle VII\n181\nScale for the Salary Cap Year in which such Free\nAgent was signed, reduced pro rata to reflect the\nplayer’s post-termination Salary), exceeds (y) the\nSalary attributable to such Standard NBA Contract.\nFor the purposes of this Section 2(d)(1)(i)(F):\n(ii)\n(1)\na Standard NBA Contract between a Team\nand a Two-Way Player (either signed\npursuant to Article II, Section 11(h), or the\nresult of the exercise of a Standard NBA\nContract Conversion Option) will be\ndeemed to be a “Standard NBA Contract\nbetween a Team and a Free Agent” provided\nthat such Two-Way Player’s Two-Way\nContract was: (i) signed by the player as a\nFree Agent; or (ii) the result of the exercise\nof the Two-Way Player Conversion Option\nprovided for in the Exhibit 10 of a Contract\nthat he signed as a Free Agent; and\n(2)\na Standard NBA Contract between a Team\nand a player under a 10-Day Contract\n(signed pursuant to Article II, Section 9(g))\nwill be deemed to be a Standard NBA\nContract between a Team and a Free Agent\nprovided that such 10-Day Contract was\nsigned by the player as a Free Agent.\n“Tax Bracket Amount” means, for a Salary Cap Year, an\namount equal to $5 million multiplied by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the Salary Cap for such Salary Cap\nYear and the denominator of which is the Salary Cap for the\n2023-24 Salary Cap Year.\nFor example, assume the Salary Cap for the 2023-24 Salary Cap\nYear is $134 million and the Salary Cap for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear is $140.7 million. The Tax Bracket Amount for the 2023-24\nSalary Cap Year would be $5 million (i.e., $5 million multiplied by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is $134 million and the denominator\nof which is $134 million), and the Tax Bracket Amount for the\n182\nArticle VII\n2024-25 Salary Cap Year would be $5.25 million (i.e., $5 million\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is $140.7 million (the\n2024-25 Salary Cap) and the denominator of which is $134 million\n(the 2023-24 Salary Cap)).\n(2) Each Team whose Tax Team Salary exceeds the Tax Level for\nany Salary Cap Year shall be required to pay a tax to the NBA. For\neach Salary Cap Year, the tax shall be calculated: (A) using the\napplicable rates in Section 2(d)(2)(i) (“Standard Tax Rates”) for any\nTeam whose Tax Team Salary did not exceed the Tax Level in three\n(3) or more of the four (4) Salary Cap Years immediately preceding\nsuch Salary Cap Year; and (B) using the applicable rates shown in\nSection 2(d)(2)(ii) (“Repeater Tax Rates”) for any Team whose Tax\nTeam Salary exceeded the Tax Level in three (3) or more of the four\n(4) Salary Cap Years immediately preceding such Salary Cap Year.\nArticle VII\n(i)\n183\nStandard Tax Rates:\nTax Rate for Increment\nIncremental Team\nSalary Above\nTax Level\n$0 – 100% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n100% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nand Over\n2023-24 and 2024-25\nSalary Cap Years\nBeginning with\n2025-26 Salary Cap\nYear\n$1.50-for-$1\n$1.00-for-$1\n$1.75-for-$1\n$1.25-for-$1\n$2.50-for-$1\n$3.50-for-$1\n$3.25-for-$1\n$4.75-for-$1\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$3.75-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$5.25-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\n184\nArticle VII\n(ii)\nRepeater Tax Rates:\nTax Rate for Increment\nIncremental Team\nSalary Above\nTax Level\n$0 – 100% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n100% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n200% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n300% of Tax\nBracket Amount –\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\n400% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nand Over\n2023-24 and 2024-25\nSalary Cap Years\nBeginning with\n2025-26 Salary Cap\nYear\n$2.50-for-$1\n$3.00-for-$1\n$2.75-for-$1\n$3.25-for-$1\n$3.50-for-$1\n$5.50-for-$1\n$4.25-for-$1\n$6.75-for-$1\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$4.75-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\nTax rates increase by\n$0.50 for each\nadditional 100% of\nTax Bracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level\n(e.g., for Tax Team\nSalary 400% of Tax\nBracket Amount to\n500% of Tax\nBracket Amount\nabove the Tax Level,\nthe Tax rate is\n$7.25-for-$1 for that\nincrement).\nExample: In respect of the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, the Tax\nBracket Amount is $5 million.

(Note, for clarity, that it is\nnecessarily the case that Team C also did not engage in the transaction set\nforth in row G of the Transactions Restriction Table at any point from the\nday following the last day of the 2024-25 Regular Season through the date\nof the Player Contract signing in this example, because such transaction can\noccur only during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year.)

Such trade (a\ntransaction set forth in row G of the Transaction Restrictions Table with\nan Applicable Apron Level of the First Apron Level): (a) is not prohibited\nby Section 2(e)(2)(i)(B) above because Team E had not previously engaged\nin any of the transactions set forth in rows A through E of the Transaction\nRestrictions Table at any point during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year (i.e.,\ntransactions that would have prohibited Team E from having an Apron\nTeam Salary that exceeds the First Apron Level in the 2023-24 Salary\nCap Year); (b) is not prohibited by Section 2(e)(2)(i)(A) above because,\nnotwithstanding that Team E’s 2023-24 Apron Team Salary exceeds\n$170 million (i.e., the 2023-24 First Apron Level), pursuant to\nSection 2(e)(5) above, a Team that uses the Transition Traded Player\nException to acquire a player during the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year will\nnot by virtue of using such Traded Player Exception be prohibited from\nhaving a 2023-24 Apron Team Salary that exceeds the 2023-24 First\nApron Level; and (c) is not prohibited by Section 2(e)(2)(ii)(A) above\nbecause, immediately following such trade, Team E’s 2024-25 Apron\nTeam Salary (calculated in accordance with Section 2(e)(3)(i) above) is less\nthan or equal to $170 million (i.e., the assumed 2024-25 First Apron\nLevel as calculated in accordance with Section 2(e)(3)(ii) above).

For example, if Team A’s and Team\nB’s first round draft picks in the 2032 NBA Draft are each\nsubject to a Draft Pick Penalty, and Team A finished with a\nbetter winning percentage than Team B for the 2031-32\nRegular Season, then Team A would make the final selection\nin the first round of the 2032 NBA Draft and Team B would\nmake the immediately preceding selection.\n(2) Beginning with the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year, if a Team is a\nSecond Apron Team for a Salary Cap Year, then:\n(i)\nthe Team shall be prohibited from trading (either\nconditionally or unconditionally) its first round draft pick in\nthe first NBA Draft that occurs following the seventh\nSeason that follows the Season occurring within such Salary\nCap Year; and\n(ii)\nwith respect to the four (4) Salary Cap Years immediately\nfollowing such Salary Cap Year:\n(A)\nIf the Team is a Second Apron Team for two (2) or\nmore of such four (4) Salary Cap Years, then such\nfirst round draft pick shall be subject to a Draft Pick\nPenalty; and\nArticle VII\n(B)\n197\nIf the Team is a Second Apron Team for fewer than\ntwo (2) of such four (4) Salary Cap Years, then, as of\nthe day following the last day of the Regular Season\nencompassed by the third of such four (4) Salary Cap\nYears in which the Team is not a Second Apron\nTeam, such Team shall be permitted to trade\n(conditionally or unconditionally) such first round\ndraft pick. For clarity, such first round draft pick\nshall not be subject to a Draft Pick Penalty.\nExample: If Team A is a Second Apron Team for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear, then it would be prohibited from trading its 2032 first round draft pick\n(i.e., its first round draft pick in the first NBA Draft that occurs following the\nseventh Season that follows the Season occurring within such Salary Cap Year).\nIf Team A is also a Second Apron Team for the 2025-26 and 2028-29 Salary\nCap Years, then Team A’s 2032 first round draft pick would be subject to a\nDraft Pick Penalty.\nExample: If Team B is a Second Apron Team for the 2024-25 Salary Cap\nYear, then it would be prohibited from trading its 2032 first round draft pick.\nIf Team B is not a Second Apron Team in the 2025-26, 2026-27, and\n2027-28 Salary Cap Years, then Team B would be permitted to trade its 2032\nfirst round draft pick as of the day following the last day of the 2027-28 Regular\nSeason (and such first round draft pick would not be subject to a Draft Pick\nPenalty).\n(g) Expansion Team Salary Caps, Minimum Team Salaries, Tax\nLevels, and Apron Levels. Each Expansion Team shall have the same\nSalary Cap, Minimum Team Salary, Tax Level, First Apron Level, and\nSecond Apron Level as all other Teams, except as follows:\n(1) During the first Salary Cap Year in which it begins play, an\nExpansion Team shall have a Salary Cap equal to sixty-six and\ntwo-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the Salary Cap calculated pursuant\nto Section 2(a) above (the “First Year Expansion Team Salary Cap”);\nand shall have a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety percent\n(90%) of the First Year Expansion Team Salary Cap.\n(2) During the Salary Cap Year immediately following the Salary\nCap Year in which it begins play, an Expansion Team shall have a\n198\nArticle VII\nSalary Cap equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Salary Cap calculated\npursuant to Section 2(a) above (the “Second Year Expansion Team\nSalary Cap”); and shall have a Minimum Team Salary equal to ninety\npercent (90%) of the Second Year Expansion Team Salary Cap.",

For purposes of this\nSection 3(a)(2)(iv), a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent who\n(x) enters into an Over 38 Contract with his Prior Team\nprior to October 1 of a Salary Cap Year, (y) is age 34 at the\ntime he enters into the Contract, and (z) will turn age 35 on\nor before such October 1 shall be deemed to be 35 at the\ntime he enters into such Over 38 Contract.\n(v)\nFor purposes of determining whether a Contract is an\nOver 38 Contract pursuant to this Section 3(a)(2) only,\nSeasons shall be deemed to commence on October 1 and\nconclude on the last day of the Salary Cap Year.\n(vi)\n“Zero Year” means, with respect to an Over 38 Contract,\nany Salary Cap Year in which the Salary called for under the\nContract has been attributed, in accordance with\nSection 3(a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) above, to prior Salary Cap Years\nof the Contract. “First Zero Year” means, with respect to\n200\nArticle VII\nan Over 38 Contract, the earliest Salary Cap Year in which\nthe Salary called for under the Contract has been attributed,\nin accordance with Section 3(a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) above, to\nprior Salary Cap Years of the Contract.\n(vii)\nFor purposes of this subsection (a)(2): (i) a player (A) whose\nbirthday is on a date during the Moratorium Period and\n(B) who signs a Contract, Extension, or Renegotiation on or\nbefore the fifth day following the date on which the\nMoratorium Period concludes shall be treated as if his age,\nat the time of such signing, was his age on the immediately\npreceding June 30; and (ii) any player whose Over 38\nContract is signed pursuant to Section 8(e)(1) below shall not\nbe considered a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent.\n(b) Signing Bonuses.\n(1) Amounts Treated as Signing Bonuses: For purposes of determining\na player’s Salary, the term “signing bonus” shall include:\n(i)\nany amount provided for in a Player Contract that is earned\nupon the signing of such Contract;\n(ii)\nat the time of a trade of a Player Contract, any amount that,\nunder the terms of the Contract, is earned in the form of a\nbonus upon the trade of the Contract; and\n(iii)\npayments in excess of the Excluded International Player\nPayment Amount, in accordance with Section 3(e) below.\n(2) Proration: Any signing bonus contained in a Player Contract\nshall be allocated over the number of Salary Cap Years (or over the\nthen-current and any remaining Salary Cap Years in the case of a\nsigning bonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above) covered by\nsuch Contract in proportion to the percentage of Base\nCompensation in each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of\nallocation, is protected for lack of skill; provided, however, that if\nthe Player Contract provides for an ETO, the foregoing allocation\nshall be performed only over Salary Cap Years that precede the\nEffective Season of such ETO. In the event that, at the time of\nallocation, none of the Base Compensation provided for by a Player\nArticle VII\n201\nContract (or none of the then-current or remaining Base\nCompensation in the case of a signing bonus described in\nSection 3(b)(1)(ii) above) is protected for lack of skill, then the entire\namount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the first Salary Cap\nYear of the Contract (or, in the case of a signing bonus described in\nSection 3(b)(1)(ii) above, the Salary Cap Year during which the\nplayer’s Contract is traded).\n(3) Extensions:\n(i)\nIn the event that a Team with a Team Salary at or over the\nSalary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or contains\na signing bonus, such signing bonus shall be paid no sooner\nthan the first day of the first Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term and shall be allocated, in equal parts, over the\nnumber of Salary Cap Years covered by the extended term\nin proportion to the percentage of Base Compensation in\neach such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of allocation, is\nprotected for lack of skill. In the event that, at the time of\nthe allocation, none of the Base Compensation provided for\nduring the extended term is protected for lack of skill, then\nthe entire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to\nthe first Salary Cap Year of the extended term.\n(ii)\nA Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may enter\ninto an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus\nto be paid at any time during the Contract’s original or\nextended term. In the event that a Team with a Team Salary\nbelow the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for\nor contains a signing bonus to be paid no sooner than the\nfirst day of the Salary Cap Year covered by such extended\nterm, the bonus shall be allocated in accordance with the\nproration rules set forth in Section 3(b)(3)(i) above. In the\nevent a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap enters\ninto an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus\nto be paid prior to the first day of the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term, the following rules shall\napply:\n202\nArticle VII\n(A)\nThe signing bonus shall be allocated over the\nremaining Salary Cap Years (including the\nthen-current Salary Cap Year) under the original\nterm of the Contract and the extended term in\nproportion to the percentage of Base Compensation\nin each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of\nallocation, is protected for lack of skill. In the event\nthat, at the time of allocation, none of the Base\nCompensation provided for during the then-current\nand any remaining Salary Cap Years under the\noriginal term of the Contract or during the extended\nterm is protected for lack of skill, then the entire\namount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the\nSalary Cap Year during which the Extension is\nsigned; and\n(B)\nThe Extension shall be deemed a Renegotiation and\nshall be subject to the rules governing\nRenegotiations set forth in Section 7 below; and\n(C)\nNotwithstanding Article II, Section 3(b), the\nExhibit 1 of such Extension must provide that the\nsigning bonus shall be paid in two (2) installments as\nfollows:\n(1)\nthe first installment shall be paid on a\nspecified date prior to the first day of the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term, and shall be for an amount\nequal to the portion of the signing bonus\nthat is allocated to the Salary Cap Year(s)\ncovered by the original term of the Contract;\nand\n(2)\nthe second installment shall be paid on a\nspecified date on or after the first day of the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term, and shall be for an amount\nequal to the portion of the signing bonus\nthat is allocated to the Salary Cap Year(s)\nArticle VII\n203\ncovered by the extended term of the\nContract.\n(iii)\nIf a Team and player enter into an Extension and provide\nthat the trade bonus provision contained in the original\nContract would not be applicable to the extended term in\naccordance with Article XXIV, Section 2(a)(v), then, in the\ncase of an earned signing bonus described in\nSection 3(b)(1)(ii) above, the signing bonus shall be allocated\nover the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Year(s)\ncovered by the original term of the extended Contract (and\nnot any of the Salary Cap Years covered by the extended\nterm) in proportion to the percentage of Base Compensation\nin each such Salary Cap Year that, at the time of allocation,\nis protected for lack of skill. In the event that, at the time of\nallocation, none of the then-current or applicable remaining\nBase Compensation is protected for lack of skill, then the\nentire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the\nSalary Cap Year during which the player’s extended Contract\nis traded.\n(iv)\nIf a Team and player enter into an Extension that contains a\ntrade bonus provision that is applicable to the Contract’s\noriginal and extended term, then, in the case of a signing\nbonus described in Section 3(b)(1)(ii) above that is earned\nprior to the first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by the\nextended term:\n(A)\nFor purposes of calculating the signing bonus and\nallocating the signing bonus to the applicable Salary\nCap Year(s), the Base Compensation in the extended\nterm of the Contract shall be the Base\nCompensation as set forth in the Contract; provided,\nhowever, that:\n(1)\nIf the Contract provides for Base\nCompensation in the first Salary Cap Year of\nthe extended term that is expressed as a\npercentage of the Salary Cap in accordance\nwith Article II, Section 7(d) or Section 7(e),\n204\nArticle VII\nthen the Base Compensation in the extended\nterm of the Contract shall be determined\nassuming that the Salary Cap will increase by\nfour and one-half percent (4.5%) each Salary\nCap Year beginning with the Salary Cap Year\nfollowing the then-current Salary Cap Year\nand ending with the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term; or\n(2)\n(B)\nIf the Contract provides for Salary plus\nUnlikely Bonuses in the first Salary Cap Year\nof the extended term that exceeds the\napplicable Maximum Annual Salary that\nwould apply to such player assuming that\n(a) the player will be credited with a Year of\nService for each remaining year of the\noriginal term of the Contract, and (b) the\nSalary Cap will increase by four and one-half\npercent (4.5%) each Salary Cap Year\nbeginning with the Salary Cap Year\nfollowing the then-current Salary Cap Year\nand ending with the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term, then the Base\nCompensation in the extended term of the\nContract shall be determined to be the Base\nCompensation that would result from the\ndeemed amendment(s) pursuant to\nArticle II, Section 7(c) using the\nassumptions described in clauses (a) and (b)\nof this subsection.\nNotwithstanding the Exhibit 4 to such Contract, the\nsigning bonus shall be paid in two (2) installments as\nfollows:\n(1)\nThe first installment shall be paid within\nthirty (30) days of the date of the trade to\nwhich the bonus applies, and shall be for an\namount equal to the portion of the signing\nbonus that is allocated to the Salary Cap\nArticle VII\n205\nYear(s) covered by the original term of the\nContract; and\n(2)\n(v)\nThe second installment shall be paid within\nthirty (30) days of the first day of the first\nSalary Cap Year covered by the extended\nterm, and shall be for an amount equal to the\nportion of the signing bonus that is allocated\nto the Salary Cap Year(s) covered by the\nextended term of the Contract.\nIn the event that a team is required to make signing bonus\npayment(s) pursuant to Section 3(b)(3)(i), 3(b)(3)(ii)(C), or\n3(b)(3)(iv) above, and the amount(s) of the signing bonus\nallocation in respect of such signing bonus are deemed\namended pursuant to Article II, Section 7(c), then the\namount of the payment required pursuant to\nSection 3(b)(3)(i), 3(b)(3)(ii)(C)(2), or 3(b)(3)(iv)(B)(2) above\nshall be reduced to equal the sum of the signing bonus\nallocation amount(s) that result from the deemed\namendment(s) pursuant to Article II, Section 7(c).\n(c) Loans to Players. The following rules shall apply to any loan made\nby any Team to a player:\n(1) If any such loan bears no interest (or annual interest at an\neffective rate lower than the “Target Rate” (as defined below)), then\nthe interest shall be imputed on the outstanding balance at a rate\nequal to the difference between the Target Rate and the actual rate\nof interest to be paid by the player and such imputed interest shall\nbe included in the player’s Salary. The “Target Rate” means the\n“Prime Rate” (as defined below) plus one percent (1%) as of the\ndate the loan is agreed upon, except that the “Target Rate” shall be\nno lower than seven percent (7%) or greater than nine percent (9%).\nFor purposes of this Section 3(c)(1), “Prime Rate” means the prime\nrate reported in the “Money Rates” column or any successor column\nof The Wall Street Journal.\n(2) No loan made to a player may (along with other outstanding\nloans to the player) exceed the amount of the player’s Salary for the\n206\nArticle VII\nthen-current Salary Cap Year that is protected for lack of skill. All\nloans must be repaid through deductions from the player’s\nremaining Current Base Compensation over the years of the\nContract that, at the time the loan is agreed upon, provide for Base\nCompensation that is fully protected for lack of skill (prior to the\nEffective Season of any ETO) in equal annual amounts (the “annual\nallocable repayment amounts”). If a loan is made at a time when the\nremaining Current Base Compensation due for the relevant Season\nthat is fully protected for lack of skill is less than the annual allocable\nrepayment amount that would be owed on a loan for the full amount\nof the player’s Current Base Compensation that is fully protected for\nlack of skill for the relevant Season (the “maximum annual allocable\nrepayment amount”), the maximum loan amount for that Season\nshall be reduced by the amount by which the maximum annual\nallocable repayment amount exceeds the amount of remaining\nCurrent Base Compensation that is fully protected for lack of skill.\n(For example, if a Player has $2 million in Current Base\nCompensation (fully protected for lack of skill) in the first Season of\na five-year Contract, and a loan is made during that Season at a time\nwhen the Player has already received his Current Base\nCompensation for that Season, the loan may not exceed\n$1.6 million.)\n(3) In addition to the restrictions set forth in Section 3(c)(2) above:\n(i) no loan may be made that would result in a violation of Article II,\nSection 13(e); and (ii) no loan may be made to a player whose\nContract provides for Base Compensation equal to the Minimum\nPlayer Salary.\n(4) Any forgiveness by a Team of a loan to a player shall be deemed\na Renegotiation in the Salary Cap Year of such forgiveness and shall\nbe subject to the rules governing Renegotiations set forth in\nSection 7 below.\n(d) Incentive Compensation.\n(1) For purposes of determining a player’s Salary each Salary Cap\nYear, except as provided in Sections 3(d)(2)-(4) below, any\nPerformance Bonus (provided such Performance Bonus may be\nincluded in a Player Contract in accordance with Section 5(b) below),\nArticle VII\n207\nshall be included in Salary only if such Performance Bonus would\nbe earned if the Team’s or player’s performance were identical to the\nperformance in the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year.\n(2) Notwithstanding Section 3(d)(1) above, in the event that, at the\ntime of the signing of a Contract, Renegotiation or Extension, the\nNBA or the Players Association believes that the performance of a\nplayer and/or his Team during the immediately preceding Salary Cap\nYear does not fairly predict the likelihood of the player earning a\nPerformance Bonus during any Salary Cap Year covered by the\nContract, Renegotiation, or extended term of the Extension (as the\ncase may be), the NBA or the Players Association may request that\na jointly selected basketball expert (“Expert”) determine whether\n(i) in the case of an NBA challenge, it is more likely than not that\nthe bonus will be earned, or (ii) in the case of a Players Association\nchallenge, it is very likely that the bonus will not be earned. The\nparty initiating a proceeding before the Expert shall carry the burden\nof proof. The Expert shall conduct a hearing within five (5) business\ndays after the initiation of the proceeding, and shall render a\ndetermination within five (5) business days after the hearing.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(d)(2), no\nparty may, in connection with any proceeding before the Expert,\nrefer to the facts that, absent a challenge pursuant to this\nSection 3(d)(2), a Performance Bonus would or would not be\nincluded in a player’s Salary pursuant to Section 3(d)(1) above, or\nwould be termed “Likely” or “Unlikely” pursuant to Article I,\nSection 1(ff) or (eeee). If, following an NBA challenge, the Expert\ndetermines that a Performance Bonus is more likely than not to be\nearned, the bonus shall be included in the player’s Salary. If,\nfollowing a Players Association challenge, the Expert determines\nthat a Performance Bonus is very likely not to be earned, the bonus\nshall be excluded from the player’s Salary. The Expert’s\ndetermination that a Performance Bonus is more likely than not to\nbe earned or very likely not to be earned shall be final, binding and\nunappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection with\nany proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 3(d)(2) shall be\nborne equally by the parties.\n(3) In the case of a Rookie or a Veteran who did not play during\nthe immediately preceding Salary Cap Year who signs a Contract\n208\nArticle VII\ncontaining a Performance Bonus, or in the case of a player signed or\nacquired by an Expansion Team whose Contract contains a\nPerformance Bonus to be paid as a result of, in whole or in part, the\nplayer’s achievement of agreed-upon benchmarks relating to the\nTeam’s performance during its first Salary Cap Year, such\nPerformance Bonus will be included in Salary if it is likely to be\nearned. In the event that the NBA and the Players Association\ncannot agree as to whether a Performance Bonus is likely to be\nearned, such dispute will be referred to the Expert, who will\ndetermine whether the bonus is likely to be earned or not likely to\nbe earned. The Expert shall conduct a hearing within five (5)\nbusiness days after the initiation of the proceeding, and shall render\na determination within five (5) business days after the hearing. The\nExpert’s determination that a Performance Bonus is likely to be\nearned or not likely to be earned shall be final, binding, and\nunappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection with\nany proceeding brought pursuant to this Section 3(d)(3) shall be\nborne equally by the parties.\n(4) In the event that either party initiates a proceeding pursuant to\nSection 3(d)(2) or (3) above, the player’s Salary plus the full amount\nof any disputed bonuses shall be included in Team Salary during the\npendency of the proceeding.\n(5) In the event the NBA and the Players Association cannot agree\non an Expert, any challenge pursuant to Sections 3(d)(2) and (3)\nabove may be filed with the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with\nArticle XXXI, Sections 2-7 and 15.\n(6) All Incentive Compensation described in Article II,\nSections 3(b)(iii) and 3(c) shall be included in Salary.\n(e) International Player Payments.\n(1) Any amount in excess of the amounts set forth below\n(“Excluded International Player Payment Amounts”) paid or to be\npaid by or at the direction of any NBA Team to (i) any basketball\nteam other than an NBA Team, or (ii) any other entity, organization,\nrepresentative or person, for the purpose of inducing a player who\nis participating in the game of basketball as a professional outside of\nArticle VII\n209\nthe United States to enter into a Player Contract or in connection\nwith securing the right to enter into a Player Contract with such a\nplayer shall be deemed Salary (in the form of a signing bonus) to the\nplayer:\nSalary Cap Year\n2023-24\n2024-25\n2025-26\n2026-27\n2027-28\n2028-29\n2029-30\nExcluded International Player\nPayment Amount\n$825,000\n$850,000\n$875,000\n$900,000\n$925,000\n$950,000\n$975,000\n(2) Subject to Article XIII, any payment up to the Excluded\nInternational Player Payment Amount for a Salary Cap Year paid by\nor at the direction of any NBA Team pursuant to Section 3(e)(1)\nabove to a professional basketball team outside the United States to\nsecure the contractual release of a player shall not be deemed Salary\nto the player.\n(3) Any payment for a Salary Cap Year paid by or at the direction\nof any NBA Team pursuant to Section 3(e)(1) above may be paid in\na single installment or in multiple installments. The Excluded\nInternational Player Payment Amount, whether used in whole or in\npart, may be used by an NBA Team whenever it signs a player to a\nnew Player Contract, except that the Excluded International Player\nPayment Amount may not be used, in whole or in part, more than\nonce in any three-Salary Cap Year period with respect to the same\nplayer.\n(4) The Excluded International Player Payment Amount, or any\npart of it, shall be deemed to have been used as of the date of the\nPlayer Contract to which it applies, regardless of when it is actually\npaid. A schedule of payments relating to the Excluded International\nPlayer Payment Amount, or any part of it, agreed upon at the time\nof the signing of the Player Contract to which it applies, shall not be\ndeemed a multiple use of the Excluded International Player Payment\nAmount.\n210\nArticle VII\n(5) Notwithstanding Section 3(e)(1) above, no amount paid or to\nbe paid pursuant to this Section 3(e) shall be counted toward the\nMinimum Team Salary obligation of a Team in accordance with\nSection 2(b) or (c) above.\n(6) Within two (2) business days following the NBA’s receipt of\nnotice of any payments made by any NBA Team that are governed\nby this Section 3(e), the NBA shall provide the Players Association\nwith written notice of such payments.\n(7) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(e),\nTeams shall be prohibited from making any payment governed by\nthis Section 3(e) for the purpose of inducing a player to enter into a\nTwo-Way Contract or a Contract with an Exhibit 10, or in\nconnection with securing the right to enter into a Two-Way Contract\nor a Contract with an Exhibit 10 with a player; and any Team that\nagrees to make a payment governed by this Section 3(e) with respect\nto a player shall be prohibited from entering into a Two-Way\nContract or a Contract with an Exhibit 10 with such player for a\nperiod of one (1) year following the date of such agreement.\n(f) One-Year Minimum Contracts. Except where otherwise stated\nin this Agreement, the Salary of every player who signs a one-year, 10-Day,\nor Rest-of-Season Contract for the Minimum Player Salary applicable to\nsuch player shall be the lesser of (1) such Minimum Player Salary, or (2) the\nportion of such Minimum Player Salary that is not reimbursed out of the\nLeague-wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section 6(h).\n(g) Insurance Premium Reimbursement. If a Team reimburses a\nplayer for life insurance premiums pursuant to Article II, Section 4(j)(ii),\nsuch premium reimbursement shall not be included in the computation of\nthe player’s Salary.\n(h) Averaging. In accordance with Article XI, Section 5(d)(iii), a\nplayer’s Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by his Contract shall be\ndeemed in certain circumstances to be the average of the aggregate Salaries\nfor each such Salary Cap Year.\n(i) Player Conduct-Related Compensation Reductions. The\ncomputation of a player’s Salary shall be made without regard to any\nArticle VII\n211\nreduction made (or to be made) to his Compensation in accordance with\nArticle VI, Section 1 or Article XLI, Section 4(e). For clarity, this\nSection 3(i) shall not apply to the computation of a player’s Adjustment\nSalary in accordance with Article VII, Section 12.\n(j) Existing Contracts. A player’s Salary with respect to any Salary\nCap Year covered by a Contract entered into prior to the effective date of\nthis Agreement shall continue to be calculated in accordance with the Salary\nCap rules that were in existence at the time the Contract was entered into\nexcept as provided in Section 7(d)(6) below. In no event shall the preceding\nsentence apply to the calculation of Salary with respect to any Contract,\nExtension (with respect to the extended term), Renegotiation, transaction,\nor event entered into or occurring on or after the effective date of this\nAgreement.",

For purposes of computing Team Salary under this\nAgreement, all of the following amounts shall be included:\n(1) Subject to the rules set forth in this Article VII, the aggregate\nSalaries of all active players (and former players to the extent\nprovided by the terms of this Agreement) attributable to a particular\nSalary Cap Year, including, without limitation:\n(i)\nSalaries paid or to be paid to players whose Player Contracts\nhave been terminated pursuant to the NBA’s waiver\nprocedure (without regard to any revised payment schedule\nthat might be provided for in the terminated Player\nContracts), except that, with respect to any Player Contract\nthat has been terminated pursuant to the NBA’s waiver\nprocedure, if the waiving Team elects in writing to have the\nplayer’s Salary stretched for Team Salary purposes in\naccordance with applicable CBA stretch rules, then the\namount to be included in Team Salary for a Salary Cap Year\nin respect of the terminated Player Contract shall equal the\namount allocated to such Salary Cap Year in accordance with\nsuch rules.\n212\nArticle VII\n(ii)\nAny amount called for in a retired player’s Player Contract\npaid or to be paid to the player. When a player retires and\nthe Team continues to pay such amounts, then, for purposes\nof computing the player’s Salary for the then-current and any\nremaining Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract, the\naggregate of such amounts, notwithstanding the payment\nschedule, shall be allocated pro rata over the then-current\nand each remaining Salary Cap Year on the basis of the\nremaining unearned protected Compensation in each such\nSalary Cap Year at the time of retirement.\n(iii)\nAmounts paid or to be paid pursuant to awards for, or\nsettlements of, Grievances between a player and a Team\nconcerning Compensation obligations under a Player\nContract in accordance with the following rules (which,\nexcept for purposes of Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(C) below, shall be\napplied with respect to each Season for which there is any\nCompensation in dispute, as if the grievance relates only to\nsuch Season):\n(A)\n(1)\nWhen a player initiates a Grievance (as\ndefined in Article XXXI) against a Team\nseeking the payment of Compensation for a\nSeason covered by the current or any future\nSalary Cap Year that the Team asserts is not\nowed, fifty percent (50%) of the disputed\namount shall be included in Team Salary for\nthe Salary Cap Year to which the Grievance\nrelates.

Notwithstanding the\npreceding sentence: (i) a Team shall be\nrequired to pay additional tax to the NBA if\nand to the extent that, due to the operation\nof this Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(2), the\naggregate tax it pays to the NBA pursuant to\nSection 2(d) above for the two (2) Salary Cap\nYears in question (the Salary Cap Year for\nwhich the fifty percent (50%) allocation was\nmade and the subsequent Salary Cap Year in\nwhich the Grievance was resolved) is less\nthan it would have been had the Grievance\nbeen resolved during the Salary Cap Year to\nwhich it related; and (ii) a Team shall be\nentitled to a tax refund from the NBA if and\nto the extent that, due to the operation of\nthis Section 4(a)(1)(iii)(A)(2), the aggregate\ntax it pays to the NBA pursuant to\nSection 2(d) above for the two (2) Salary Cap\nYears in question is greater than it would\nhave been had the grievance been resolved\nduring the Salary Cap Year to which it\nrelated. In order to facilitate any such\n214\nArticle VII\nrequired tax refund from the NBA to the\nTeam, the NBA shall set aside, pending\nresolution of the Grievance, the amount of\ntax paid by that Team in the Salary Cap Year\nto which the Grievance relates that is\nattributable to the fifty percent (50%)\nallocation. Following resolution of the\nGrievance, the NBA shall pay to the Team\nthe tax refund to which it is entitled (if any)\nbased upon the resolution of the Grievance,\nand the remainder of the set aside tax funds\nshall be distributed by the NBA to one (1) or\nmore Teams or otherwise used by the\nLeague in such manner as the NBA may\nreasonably determine, consistent with the\nprovisions of Section 2(d)(4) above.\n(B)\nWhen a player initiates a Grievance against a Team\nseeking the payment of Compensation for a Season\ncovered by a prior Salary Cap Year that the Team\nasserts is not owed, following resolution of the\nGrievance, whether by award or settlement, the\ndisputed amount payable by the Team, if any, shall\nbe included in Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year\nin which the Grievance is resolved (but only to the\nextent that it had been previously excluded from\nTeam Salary).

A Team’s failure to comply with the\npreceding sentence may be considered evidence of a\nviolation of Article XIII. If a Team delays or\nattempts to delay in any manner the processing or\nresolution of a Grievance relating to a player’s\nCompensation for the purpose of creating or\nincreasing its Room in any Salary Cap Year or for the\npurpose of reducing or deferring a tax payment to\nthe NBA, such conduct shall constitute a violation\nof Article XIII.\nSalaries anticipated to be included in Team Salary based\nupon any agreement disclosed to the NBA pursuant to\nArticle II, Section 13(a)(i) (including, without limitation, any\nexecuted Player Contract whose validity is conditional on the\npassage of a physical examination by the player or on the\n216\nArticle VII\nassignment of the Contract), except to the extent that any\nsuch Salary is less than a player’s Free Agent Amount (as\ndefined in Section 4(d) below).\n(2) (i) With respect to each Veteran Free Agent who last played for\na Team who is an Unrestricted Free Agent, the Free Agent\nAmount (as defined in Section 4(d) below) attributable to\nsuch Veteran Free Agent.\n(ii)\nWith respect to each Veteran Free Agent who last played for\na Team who is a Restricted Free Agent, the greater of (A) the\nFree Agent Amount (as defined in Section 4(d) below)\nattributable to such Veteran Free Agent, (B) the Salary called\nfor in any outstanding Qualifying Offer (other than a\nTwo-Way Qualifying Offer, as defined in Article XI,\nSection 1(e)(iii)(B) below) tendered to such Veteran Free\nAgent (or, if the Restricted Free Agent was also tendered a\nMaximum Qualifying Offer pursuant to Article XI,\nSection 4(a)(ii), the Salary called for in such outstanding\nMaximum Qualifying Offer), or (C) the Salary called for in\nany First Refusal Exercise Notice (as defined in Article XI,\nSection 5(g)) issued with respect to such Veteran Free Agent.\n(3) The aggregate Salaries called for under all outstanding Offer\nSheets (as defined in Article XI, Section 5(b)).\n(4) An amount with respect to a Team’s unsigned First Round\nPick, if any, as determined in accordance with Section 4(e) below.\n(5) An amount with respect to the number of players fewer than\ntwelve (12) included in a Team’s Team Salary, as determined in\naccordance with Section 4(f) below.\n(6) Value or consideration received by retired players that is\ndetermined to be includable in Team Salary in accordance with\nArticle XIII, Section 5.\n(7) The amount of any Salary Cap Exception that is deemed\nincluded in Team Salary in accordance with Section 6(n)(2) below.\nArticle VII\n217\n(8) An amount, if any, included in Team Salary in accordance with\nthe Minimum Team Salary rules set forth in Section 2(c)(3) above.\n(b) Expansion.

If, after such following July 1, or any\nsubsequent July 1, the player signs another, or remains under,\ncontract with a non-NBA team, the player’s applicable Rookie Scale\nCap Hold Amount will again be excluded from Team Salary\nbeginning on the date of the contract signing or the first day of the\nRegular Season commencing after such July 1, whichever is later,\nand will again be included in Team Salary at the applicable Rookie\nScale Cap Hold Amount on the following July 1 or the date the\nplayer’s contract ends (or the player is released from his non-NBA\ncontractual obligations), whichever is earlier, unless the Team\nrenounces its exclusive rights to the player in accordance with\nArticle X, Section 4(g).\n(3) A Team that holds draft rights to a First Round Pick may elect\nto have the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Cap Hold Amount\n220\nArticle VII\nexcluded from its Team Salary at any time prior to the first day of\nany Regular Season by providing the NBA with a written statement\nthat the Team will not sign the player during that Salary Cap Year\naccompanied by a written statement from the First Round Pick\nrenouncing his right to accept any outstanding Required Tender\nmade to him by the Team. After making such an election, (i) the\nTeam shall be prohibited from signing the player during that Salary\nCap Year, except in accordance with Section 5(c)(4)(ii) below, (ii) the\nTeam shall continue to possess such rights with respect to the player\nthat the Team possessed pursuant to Article X immediately prior to\nsuch election, and (iii) the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount\nshall be included again in his Team’s Team Salary at the applicable\nRookie Scale Cap Hold Amount on the following July 1. When a\nFirst Round Pick provides a Team with a written statement\nrenouncing his right to accept that year’s outstanding Required\nTender, the Player shall no longer be permitted to accept it.\n(4) For purposes of this Section 4(e), in the event that a First\nRound Pick does not sign a Contract with the Team that holds his\ndraft rights during the Salary Cap Year immediately following the\nDraft in which he was selected (or during the same Salary Cap Year\nin which he was drafted if the Draft occurs on or after July 1), the\n“applicable Rookie Scale Amount” for such First Round Pick\nmeans, with respect to any subsequent Salary Cap Year, the Rookie\nScale Amount that would apply if the player were drafted in the\nDraft immediately preceding such Salary Cap Year at the same draft\nposition at which he was actually selected.\n(f) Incomplete Rosters.\n(1) If at any time from July 1 through the day prior to the first day\nof the Regular Season a Team has fewer than twelve (12) players,\ndetermined in accordance with Section 4(f)(2) below, included in its\nTeam Salary, then the Team’s Team Salary shall be increased by an\namount calculated as follows:\nSTEP 1:\nSubtract from twelve (12) the number of players\nincluded in Team Salary.\nArticle VII\nSTEP 2:\n221\nIf the result in Step 1 is a positive number, multiply the\nresult in Step 1 by the Minimum Annual Salary\napplicable to players with zero (0) Years of Service under\nthe Minimum Annual Salary Scale for that Salary Cap\nYear.\n(2) In determining whether a Team has fewer than twelve (12)\nplayers included in its Team Salary for purposes of Section 4(f)(1)\nabove only, the only players who shall be counted are (i) players\nunder Contract with the Team who are included in Team Salary,\n(ii) Free Agents who are included in Team Salary pursuant to\nSection 4(a)(2) above, (iii) players to whom Offer Sheets have been\ngiven, and (iv) unsigned First Round Picks who are included in Team\nSalary pursuant to Section 4(e) above.\n(g) Renouncing.\n(1) To renounce a Veteran Free Agent, a Team must provide the\nNBA with a written statement renouncing its right to re-sign the\nplayer, effective no earlier than the July 1 following the last Season\ncovered by the player’s Contract. (The NBA shall notify the Players\nAssociation of any such renunciation by email within two (2)\nbusiness days following receipt of notice of such renunciation.) If a\nTeam renounces a Veteran Free Agent, the player will no longer\nqualify as a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early Qualifying Veteran\nFree Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, as the case may\nbe, and the Team will only be permitted to re-sign such player with\nRoom (i.e., the Team cannot sign such player pursuant to Section\n6(b) below), pursuant to the Minimum Player Salary Exception, or\nto a Two-Way Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the\nevent a Team renounces one or more players pursuant to this\nSection 6(g) (or, with respect to a First Round Pick, pursuant to\nArticle X, Section 4(g)) in order to create Room for an Offer Sheet,\nand the offeree-player’s Prior Team subsequently matches the Offer\nSheet and enters into a Contract with that player, the Team may\nrescind the renunciation (in the case where a Team renounces only\none player) or all such renunciations (in the case where the Team\nrenounces more than one player) within two (2) business days of the\ndate the Offer Sheet is matched (or, if the Prior Team conditions its\nmatch on the player reporting for and passing a physical, within\n222\nArticle VII\ntwo (2) business days of the player passing the physical), whereupon\nany such “unrenounced” player may again sign a Player Contract\nwith the Team as a First Round Pick, Qualifying Veteran Free Agent,\nEarly Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran\nFree Agent, as the case may be, and will again be included in his\nPrior Team’s Team Salary at his applicable Free Agent Amount;\nprovided, however, that a Team may not rescind the renunciation of\na player if (i) at the time the player was renounced, the Team’s Team\nSalary was at or below the Salary Cap and “unrenouncing” the player\nwould cause the Team’s Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap, or\n(ii) at the time the player was renounced, the Team’s Team Salary\nwas above the Salary Cap and “unrenouncing” the player would\ncause the Team’s Team Salary to exceed the Salary Cap by more than\nthe amount by which the Team’s Team Salary exceeded the Salary\nCap prior to the renunciation.\n(2) A Team cannot renounce any player who is a Restricted Free\nAgent.\n(h) Long-Term Injuries. Any player who suffers a career-ending\ninjury or illness, and whose Contract is terminated by the Team in\naccordance with the NBA waiver procedure, will be excluded from his\nTeam’s Team Salary as follows:\n(1) Subject to Section 4(h)(5) below, a Team may apply to the NBA\nto have the player’s Salary for each remaining Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the Contract excluded from Team Salary beginning on\nthe first anniversary of the date of the last Regular Season, Play-In,\nor playoff game in which the player played; provided, however, that\nif the player played in fewer than ten (10) Regular Season, Play-In,\nand playoff games in the last Season in which he played, then the\nearliest date upon which a Team may apply to the NBA to have the\nplayer’s Salary excluded from its Team Salary in accordance with this\nSection 4(h) shall be the later of (A) sixty (60) days following the\ndate during such Season in which the player last played in a Regular\nSeason, Play-In, or playoff game, and (B) the first anniversary of the\ndate during a prior Season in which the player last played in a Regular\nSeason, Play-In, or playoff game under such Contract.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4(h)(1), a\nTeam may not apply to have a player’s Salary excluded from Team\nArticle VII\n223\nSalary prior to the first anniversary of the date of the first Regular\nSeason game that the player is on the Team’s roster under the\nContract in question.\n(2) The determination of whether a player has suffered a\ncareer-ending injury or illness shall be made by a physician selected\njointly by the NBA and the Players Association or, upon agreement\nof the NBA and the Players Association, a Fitness-to-Play Panel\nestablished under Article XXII. A player shall be deemed to have\nsuffered a career-ending injury or illness if it is determined (i) by such\na physician or Fitness-to-Play Panel that the player has an injury or\nillness that (x) prevents him from playing skilled professional\nbasketball at an NBA level for the duration of his career, or\n(y) substantially impairs his ability to play skilled professional\nbasketball at an NBA level and is of such severity that continuing to\nplay professional basketball at an NBA level would subject the player\nto medically unacceptable risk of suffering a life-threatening or\npermanently disabling injury or illness, or (ii) by such Fitness-to-Play\nPanel that the player has an injury or illness that would create a\nmaterially elevated risk of death, paralysis, or other permanent spinal\ninjury for the player under the procedures set forth in Article XXII,",

For clarity, a Team that acquires one (1) or\nmore players in accordance with this Section 6(j)(1)(v) (or\nwith room under the Salary Cap (i.e., without making use of\nthe additional $250,000)) may not simultaneously acquire\nany players in accordance with Sections 6(j)(1)(i)-(iv) above.\n242\nArticle VII\n(2) In lieu of conducting a trade in accordance with\nSection 6(j)(1)(v) above, and notwithstanding Section 6(n) below\nand subject to Section 2(e) above and Section 6(j)(6) below, a Team\nwith a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may conduct a trade in\naccordance with Sections 6(j)(1)(iii)-(iv) above.\n(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6(j)(1)\nabove, if a Team’s post-assignment Apron Team Salary would\nexceed the First Apron Level, then the $250,000 allowance\nreferenced in each of Sections 6(j)(1)(i)-(v) above shall be reduced\nto $0.\n(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6(j)(1)\nabove, the following rules will apply when a Team is aggregating the\nContracts of two (2) or more Traded Players in a trade pursuant to\na Traded Player Exception set forth in Section 6(j)(1)(ii), 6(j)(1)(iii),\nor 6(j)(1)(iv) above:\n(i)\nNo player whose Player Contract was acquired pursuant to\nan Exception in the two (2) month period preceding the\ntrade may be among the Traded Players whose Contracts are\nbeing aggregated pursuant to Sections 6(j)(ii), 6(j)(iii), or\n6(j)(iv) above (for example, if a player were traded to a Team\npursuant to an Exception on November 20, 2023, then the\nplayer’s Contract could not be aggregated with any other\nContract for purposes of a trade until January 20, 2024);\nprovided, however, that if a Team acquires a Player Contract\npursuant to an Exception on or before December 16 of a\nSalary Cap Year, then the foregoing restriction shall not\napply in the event the player is subsequently traded on or\nafter the day prior to the NBA trade deadline of such Salary\nCap Year; and\n(ii)\nOther than during the period beginning on December 15 of\na Salary Cap Year through the NBA trade deadline of such\nSalary Cap Year, if a Team is aggregating the Contracts of\nthree (3) or more Traded Players in a trade and the number\nof Replacement Players that the Team is acquiring in respect\nof such Traded Players is less than the number of such\nTraded Players, then no more than one (1) of such Traded\nArticle VII\n243\nPlayers may be a Minimum Traded Player (as defined\nbelow). For the purposes of this rule only, a “Minimum\nTraded Player” is a player whose Contract provides for his\napplicable Minimum Player Salary for the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich the trade of his Contract occurs or, if the trade occurs\nduring the period beginning on the day after the last day of\nthe Regular Season of a Salary Cap Year through the last day\nof such Salary Cap Year, a player whose Contract provides\nfor his applicable Minimum Player Salary in the immediately\nfollowing Salary Cap Year.\n(5) If (x) a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or Early Qualifying\nVeteran Free Agent and his prior Team enter into a Player Contract,\nin accordance with Section 6(b)(1) or (3) above, in connection with\nan agreement to trade the Contract in accordance with Section 8(e)\nbelow, (y) the Team’s Team Salary immediately following such\nContract signing is above the Salary Cap, and (z) the new Contract\nto be traded provides for Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for the first\nSeason of such Contract in excess of the Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses that could have been provided for by the Contract had the\nplayer been a Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent and the Contract\nhad been signed pursuant to Section 6(b)(2) above, then for\npurposes of calculating the assignor Team’s Traded Player\nException, the player’s Salary shall be deemed equal to the greater\nof (i) the Salary for the last Season of his preceding Contract, or\n(ii) fifty percent (50%) of the Salary for the first Season of his new\nContract. For purposes of this Section 6(j)(5), if the player’s\nimmediately prior Contract was a one-year Contract that provided\nfor Salary equal to the Minimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of\nany kind), the player’s prior Salary shall include the portion of the\nMinimum Player Salary, if any, that was reimbursed out of the\nLeague-wide benefits fund described in Article IV, Section 6(h).\n(6) For purposes of calculating a Team’s Traded Player Exception\nunder this Section 6(j), a Traded Player’s Salary shall be deemed\nreduced by the amount of the player’s unearned Base Compensation\nthat, at the time of the trade, is not fully protected for lack of skill\nand injury or illness (or may become not fully protected for lack of\nskill and injury or illness due to additional conditions or limitations\n244\nArticle VII\nset forth in the Exhibit 2 of the player’s Contract). For purposes of\nthis Section 6(j)(6):\n(i)\nWith respect to the assignment of Player Contracts\noccurring during the period from January 8 through the last\nday of the Regular Season, a Traded Player’s Base\nCompensation for such Season shall be deemed fully\nprotected for lack of skill and injury or illness;\n(ii)\nWith respect to the assignment of a Player Contract that is a\none-year Contract that provides for Salary equal to the\nMinimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind), the\nplayer’s unearned Base Compensation shall exclude the\nportion of the Minimum Player Salary, if any, that is\nreimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund described\nin Article IV, Section 6(h); and\n(iii)\nWith respect to the assignment of Player Contracts\noccurring during the period from the day following the last\nday of a Regular Season through June 30 of that Salary Cap\nYear, a Traded Player’s Salary will equal the lesser of: (x) the\nplayer’s Salary for the current Salary Cap Year; and (y) the\nplayer’s Salary for the subsequent Salary Cap Year reduced\nby the amount of the player’s unearned Base Compensation\nfor the subsequent Salary Cap Year that, at the time of the\ntrade, is not fully protected for lack of skill and injury or\nillness (or may become not fully protected for lack of skill\nand injury or illness due to additional conditions or\nlimitations set forth in the Exhibit 2 of the player’s\nContract).\nTo illustrate the foregoing, assume that a Team seeks to replace a\nTraded Player whose Contract provides for (i) Base Compensation and\nSalary for each of the 2023-24 and 2024-25 Seasons of $8 million,\nand (ii) Base Compensation protection for lack of skill and injury or\nillness equal to $1 million for each such Season. If the trade of such\nTraded Player occurs on:\n(W) the day prior to the first day of the 2023-24 Regular Season, the\nTraded Player’s Salary for purposes of calculating the Team’s Traded\nArticle VII\n245\nPlayer Exception under this Section 6(j) would be $1 million\n($8 million (the player’s 2023-24 Salary) reduced by $7 million (the\namount of the player’s unearned 2023-24 Base Compensation that is\nnot fully protected for lack of skill and injury or illness at the time of\nthe trade));\n(X) after one-quarter of the 2023-24 Regular Season has elapsed, the\nTraded Player’s Salary for purposes of calculating the Team’s Traded\nPlayer Exception under this Section 6(j) would be $2 million ($8\nmillion (the player’s 2023-24 Salary) reduced by $6 million ($8\nmillion multiplied by 75% – the amount of the player’s unearned\n2023-24 Base Compensation that is not fully protected for lack of skill\nand injury or illness at the time of the trade));\n(Y) on January 8, 2024, the Traded Player’s Salary for purposes of\ncalculating the Team’s Traded Player Exception under this Section 6(j)\nwould be $8 million ($8 million (the player’s 2023-24 Salary) reduced\nby $0 (pursuant to Section 6(j)(6)(i) above, the deemed amount of the\nplayer’s unearned 2023-24 Base Compensation that is not fully\nprotected for lack of skill and injury or illness at the time of the trade));\nand\n(Z) on the day following the last day of the 2023-24 Regular Season,\nthe Traded Player’s Salary for purposes of calculating the Team’s\nTraded Player Exception under this Section 6(j) would be $1 million\n(the lesser of: (i) $8 million ($8 million (the player’s 2023-24 Salary)\nreduced by $0 (the amount of the player’s unearned 2023-24 Base\nCompensation that is not fully protected for lack of skill and injury or\nillness at the time of the trade)), and (ii) $1 million ($8 million (the\nplayer’s 2024-25 Salary) reduced by $7 million (the amount of the\nplayer’s unearned 2024-25 Base Compensation that is not fully\nprotected for lack of skill and injury or illness at the time of the trade)).\n(7) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(j),\nno Traded Player Exception shall arise from trading a player during\na Salary Cap Year if the Team has previously used (or simultaneously\nuses) a Disabled Player Exception in respect of such player during\nsuch Salary Cap Year.\n246\nArticle VII\n(8) The foregoing rules in this Section 6(j) shall not apply to\nTwo-Way Players. Accordingly, for example, a Traded Player\nException will not arise from trading a Two-Way Player.\n(k) Second Round Pick Exception. A Team that holds the draft\nrights to a Second Round Pick may use the Second Round Pick Exception\nto sign such player to a Player Contract in accordance with the following:\n(1) The term of a Player Contract signed pursuant to the Second\nRound Pick Exception must be either: (i) two (2) Seasons with an\nOption in favor of the Team for a third Season; or (ii) three (3)\nSeasons with an Option in favor of the Team for a fourth Season.\n(2) If a Player Contract signed pursuant to the Second Round Pick\nException has a term of two (2) Seasons with an Option in favor of\nthe Team for a third Season, then such Contract must provide for:\n(i)\nSalary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the\nMinimum Player Salary applicable to a player with one (1)\nYear of Service; and\n(ii)\nthe player’s applicable Minimum Player Salary for the second\nSeason and the Option Year.\nFor clarity, the foregoing amounts shall be those as set forth in the\nMinimum Annual Scale for the Salary Cap Year in which the\nContract is signed.\n(3) If a Player Contract signed pursuant to the Second Round Pick\nException has a term of three (3) Seasons with an Option in favor\nof the Team for a fourth Season, then such Contract must provide\nfor:\n(i)\nSalary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the first Season of up to the\nMinimum Player Salary applicable to a player with two (2)\nYear of Service;\n(ii)\nSalary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the second Season of up to\nthe amount shown in the “Year 2” column for a player with\ntwo (2) Years of Service in the Minimum Annual Salary\nScale; and\nArticle VII\n(iii)\n247\nthe player’s applicable Minimum Player Salary for the third\nSeason and the Option Year.\nFor clarity, the foregoing amounts shall be those as set forth in the\nMinimum Annual Scale for the Salary Cap Year in which the\nContract is signed.\n(4) For Player Contracts signed in accordance with Section 6(k)(3)\nabove, annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses from the first Season to the second Season shall be\ngoverned by Section 5(a)(1) above.\n(l) Reinstatement. If a player has been dismissed and disqualified\nfrom further association with the NBA and subsequently reinstated\npursuant to Article XXXIII (Anti-Drug Agreement), the Team for which\nthe player last played may enter into a Player Contract with such player in\naccordance with the applicable rules set forth in Article XXXIII,\nSection 13(f) or (g), even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the\nSalary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a Team Salary\nabove the Salary Cap. If, in accordance with the preceding sentence, a Team\nand a player enter into a Player Contract and such Contract covers more\nthan one (1) Season, annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses shall be governed by Section 5(a)(1) above.\n(m) Non-Aggregation. Other than in accordance with Section 6(j)\nabove, a Team may not aggregate or combine any of the Exceptions set\nforth above in order to sign or acquire one (1) or more players at Salaries\ngreater than that permitted by any one of the Exceptions. If a Team has\nmore than one (1) Exception available at the same time, the Team shall have\nthe right to choose which Exception it wishes to use to sign or acquire a\nplayer.\n(n) Other Rules.\n(1) A Team shall be entitled to use the Disabled Player Exception,\nBi-annual Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception,\nTaxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception, and a Traded Player\nException set forth in Sections 6(c), (d), (e), (f), and (j) above,\nrespectively, except as set forth in Sections 6(j)(1)(v) and 6(j)(2)\nabove, only if, at the time any such Exception would arise and at all\n248\nArticle VII\ntimes until it is used, the Team’s Team Salary, excluding the\namount(s) of such Exception and any other Exception that would\nbe included in Team Salary pursuant to Section 6(n)(2) below, is (i) at\nor above the Salary Cap, or (ii) below the Salary Cap by less than the\namount(s) of the Team’s Exception(s) (excluding the amount of the\nTaxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception unless the Team is no longer\nable to use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception but\nremains able to use the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception, in\nwhich case the amount of the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception\nshall be included).\n(2) In the event that when a Disabled Player Exception, Bi-annual\nException, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception (or the\nTaxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception instead of the Non-Taxpayer\nMid-Level Salary Exception if the Team is no longer able to use the\nNon-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception but remains able to use\nthe Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception), and/or a Traded Player\nException arises, the Team’s Team Salary is below the Salary Cap\n(or in the event that, prior to the expiration of any such Exceptions,\nthe Team’s Team Salary falls below the Salary Cap) by less than the\namount of such Exceptions, then (i) the Team’s Team Salary shall\ninclude, until the Exceptions are actually used or until the Team no\nlonger is entitled to use the Exceptions, the amount of the\nExceptions (or any unused portion of the Exceptions), and (ii) the\namount by which the Team’s Team Salary is less than the Salary Cap\nshall thereby be extinguished. When the Disabled Player Exception\nis used to sign or acquire a player, the Replacement Player’s Salary\nfor the Season covered by his Contract, instead of the amount of the\nException, shall be included in Team Salary. When a Bi-annual\nException, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception, Taxpayer\nMid-Level Salary Exception, or Traded Player Exception is used to\nsign or acquire a player (as applicable), the Salary for the first Season\nof the signed Contract or the Salary for the then-current Salary Cap\nYear of the acquired Contract (as applicable), plus any then-unused\nportion of the Exception (instead of the full amount of the\nException), shall be included in Team Salary. A Team may at any\ntime renounce its rights to use an Exception, in which case the\nException (or any unused portion of the Exception) will no longer\nbe included in Team Salary.\nArticle VII\n249\n(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if\na player is a Veteran Free Agent following the second or third Season\nof his Rookie Scale Contract (where the first Option Year or second\nOption Year (as applicable) to extend such Contract was not\nexercised), then any new Player Contract between the player and the\nTeam that signed him to his Rookie Scale Contract (and/or, if such\nContract was subsequently assigned, any such assignee Team) may\nprovide for Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses, and Unlikely Bonuses in\nthe first Salary Cap Year of up to the Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses,\nand Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, that the player would have\nreceived for such Salary Cap Year had his first or second Option\nYear (as applicable) been exercised.

Should the player consent (or if the player\nand Team agreed at the time of signing to eliminate his right to consent)\nand the player is traded (except if the Contract has an Option for the\nsecond year that was exercised prior to the trade), then, for purposes of\ndetermining whether the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, Early\nQualifying Veteran Free Agent, or Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent at\nthe conclusion of the Contract or any subsequent Contract between the\nplayer and the assignee Team, the player shall be considered as having\nchanged Teams by means of signing a Contract with the assignee Team as\nArticle VII\n261\na Free Agent (and not by means of trade). For clarity, for any player who\ndid not agree at the time of signing to eliminate his right to consent, such\nright under this Section 8(b) shall continue following the initial trade of\nthe player’s Contract and any proposed subsequent trade of such Contract\nduring the term thereof (not including any Option Year).\n(c) A Team cannot trade any player after the NBA trade deadline\noccurring in the last Season of the player’s Contract, or after the NBA\ntrade deadline occurring in any Season that could be the last Season of the\nplayer’s Contract based upon the exercise or non-exercise of an Option or\nEarly Termination Option.\n(d) (i)\nNo Draft Rookie who signs a Standard NBA Contract or\nplayer who signs a Two-Way Contract may be traded\nbefore thirty (30) days following the date on which the\nContract is signed.\n(ii)\nNo player who signs a Standard NBA Contract as a Free\nAgent (or who signs a Standard NBA Contract while under\na Two-Way Contract) may be traded before the later of\n(A) three (3) months following the date on which such\nContract was signed or (B) the December 15 of the Salary\nCap Year in which such Contract was signed; provided,\nthat if a Contract is signed in connection with an\nagreement to trade the Contract in accordance with\nSection 8(e) below, the foregoing rule shall not apply to the\ninitial trade but shall instead be applicable if the Contract\nis traded a second time. For the purposes of this rule, a\nTwo-Way Contract that is converted to a Standard NBA\nContract pursuant to such Contract’s Standard NBA\nContract Conversion Option will be deemed to be a\nStandard NBA Contract signed by a Free Agent on the\ndate of the conversion.\n(iii)\nNotwithstanding the rule set forth in Section (d)(ii) above,\nany player who signs a Standard NBA Contract with his\nprior Team meeting the following criteria may not be\ntraded before the later of (x) three (3) months following\nthe date on which such Contract was signed or (y) the\nJanuary 15 of the Salary Cap Year in which such Contract\n262\nArticle VII\nwas signed: the Team Salary of the player’s Team is above\nthe Salary Cap immediately following the Contract signing\nand the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or Early\nQualifying Veteran Free Agent who, in accordance with\nSection 6(b)(1) or (3) above, enters into a new Player\nContract with his prior Team that provides for a Salary for\nthe first Season of such new Contract greater than one\nhundred twenty percent (120%) of the Salary for the last\nSeason of the player’s immediately prior Contract. The\nrule set forth in this Section (d)(iii) shall not apply to a\nplayer if his new Contract provides for Salary equal to the\nMinimum Player Salary (with no bonuses of any kind). For\npurposes of the foregoing sentence, if the player’s\nimmediately prior Contract was a one-year Contract that\nprovided for Salary equal to the Minimum Player Salary\n(with no bonuses of any kind), the player’s prior Salary\nshall include the portion of the Minimum Player Salary, if\nany, that was reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits\nfund described in Article IV, Section 6(h).\n(e) (1) Subject to the rules set forth in Section 2(e) above, a Veteran\nFree Agent and his Prior Team may enter into a Player Contract\npursuant to an agreement between the Prior Team and another\nTeam concerning the signing and subsequent trade of such\nContract, but only if (i) the Veteran Free Agent finished the prior\nSeason on his Prior Team’s roster, (ii) the Contract is for at least\nthree (3) Seasons (excluding any Option Year) but no more than\nfour (4) Seasons in length, (iii) the Contract is not signed pursuant\nto the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception or the\nMid-Level Salary Exception for Room Teams, (iv) the first Season\nof the Contract is fully protected for lack of skill, (v) the Contract\nis entered into prior to the first day of the Regular Season, (vi) with\nrespect to any 5th Year Eligible Player (as defined in Article II,\nSection 7) who met one of the Higher Max Criteria (as defined in\nArticle II, Section 7), the Contract may not provide the player with\nSalary (plus Unlikely Bonuses) in excess of twenty-five percent\n(25%) of the Salary Cap (as calculated pursuant to Article II,\nSection 7) in effect at the time the Contract is signed, and (vii) the\nacquiring Team has Room for the player’s Salary plus any Unlikely\nBonuses provided for in the first Season of the Contract.\nArticle VII\n263\n(2) A player and his Team may amend a Player Contract\n(including by entering into an Extension but not by entering into\na Renegotiation) pursuant to an agreement between such Team\nand another Team concerning the signing of the amendment and\nsubsequent trade of the amended Contract; provided, however,\nthat: (i) no such agreement may be made during the period from\nthe last day of the last Regular Season covered by the Contract (or\nthe last day of any Regular Season that could be the last Regular\nSeason covered by the Contract based upon the exercise or\nnon-exercise of an Option or ETO) through the following\nJune 30; (ii) no such Extension entered into pursuant to this\nSection 8(e)(2) prior to the first day of the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year\nmay cover more than three (3) Seasons from the date the\nExtension is signed; and (iii) no such Extension entered into\npursuant to this Section 8(e)(2) on or after the first day of the\n2024-25 Salary Cap Year may cover more than four (4) Seasons\nfrom the date the Extension is signed. The Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses that may be provided in the first year of the extended\nterm and annual increases and decreases in Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses shall be governed by Section 7(a)(3)(iii) and\nSection 5(a)(4) above.\n(3) A Player Contract or Extension entered into pursuant to\nSection 8(e)(1) or (2) above may not contain an Exhibit 6 thereto.\nHowever, the preceding sentence shall not prohibit the Teams\ninvolved in the trade from agreeing that the trade (and thus the\nvalidity of the Player Contract or Extension) will be conditional\nupon the passage of a physical examination to be performed by a\nphysician designated by the assignee-Team in accordance with\nNBA procedures.\n(f) (i)\nIn the event a player enters into (A) an Extension pursuant\nto Section 7(a) above (other than a Designated Veteran\nPlayer Extension governed by Section (f)(ii) below) that\ncovers five (5) Seasons (or, for Extensions entered into\nprior to the first day of the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year,\nfour (4) or more Seasons) and/or provides for Salary and\nUnlikely Bonuses or annual increases or decreases in the\nplayer’s Salary and Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the\namounts that, at the time such Extension was entered into,\n264\nArticle VII\nwere permissible in Extensions entered into in connection\nwith an agreement to trade the Contract pursuant to\nSection 8(e)(2) above, or (B) a Renegotiation pursuant to\nSection 7(c) above, then the player may not be traded\nbefore six (6) months following the date on which such\nExtension or Renegotiation was signed. If a team acquires\na player in a trade, then, for a period of six (6) months\nfollowing the date of the trade, the team may not enter into\n(X) an Extension with the player pursuant to Section 7(a)\nabove that covers five (5) Seasons (or, if the trade occurred\nprior to the first day of the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year,\nfour (4) or more Seasons) and/or provides for Salary and\nUnlikely Bonuses or annual increases or decreases in the\nplayer’s Salary and/or Unlikely Bonuses in excess of the\namounts that, at the time such trade occurred, were\npermissible in Extensions entered into in connection with\nan agreement to trade the Contract pursuant to\nSection 8(e)(2) above, or (Y) a Renegotiation pursuant to\nSection 7(c) above.\n(ii)\nIn the event a player enters into a Designated Veteran\nPlayer Extension pursuant to Section 7(a)(3)(ii) above or a\nDesignated Veteran Player Contract pursuant to Article II,\nSection 7, the player may not be traded before one (1) year\nfollowing the date on which he entered into such\nDesignated Veteran Player Extension or Designated\nVeteran Player Contract.\n(g) In the event a Rookie Scale Contract is extended pursuant to\nSection 7(b) above and a Team proposes to trade such Contract to another\nTeam prior to the first day of the Salary Cap Year immediately following\nsuch Extension, then, only for purposes of determining whether the\nacquiring Team has Room for the Contract, the Salary for the last Salary\nCap Year of the original term of the Contract shall be deemed to equal the\naverage of the aggregate Salaries for such Salary Cap Year and each Salary\nCap Year of the extended term. For purposes of this subsection (g), the\nSalary for each Salary Cap Year of the extended term of the Contract shall\nbe the Salary as set forth in the Contract; provided, however, that:\nArticle VII\n265\n(i)\nIf the Contract provides for Base Compensation in the\nfirst Salary Cap Year of the extended term that is expressed\nas a percentage of the Salary Cap in accordance with\nArticle II, Section 7(d), then the Base Compensation in the\nextended term of the Contract shall be determined\nassuming that (a) the Salary Cap in the first Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the extended term will equal one hundred four\nand one-half percent (104.5%) of the Salary Cap in effect\nat the time that the proposed trade would occur, and\n(b) the player does not meet any of the applicable Higher\nMax Criteria during the fourth Season of his Rookie Scale\nContract; or\n(ii)\nIf the Contract provides for Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses\nin the first Salary Cap Year of the extended term that\nexceeds the applicable Maximum Annual Salary that would\napply to such player assuming that the Salary Cap in the\nfirst Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term will\nequal one hundred four and one-half percent (104.5%) of\nthe Salary Cap in effect at the time that the proposed trade\nwould occur, then the Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses in the\nextended term of the Contract shall be determined to be\nthe Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses that would result from\nthe deemed amendment(s) pursuant to Article II,\nSection 7(c) using the assumption described above in this\nsubsection (ii).\n(h) If a Team trades a player and the assignee Team subsequently\nplaces the player on waivers, the assignor Team shall not be permitted to\nsign the player to a new Contract (or claim the player off of waivers) before\nthe earlier of: (i) one (1) year following the date all conditions to the trade\nwere satisfied; or (ii) the July 1 following the last Season of the player’s\nPlayer Contract.\n(i) Prior to the assignment of any Player Contract, the Team from\nwhich such Player Contract is to be assigned and the player whose Player\nContract is to be assigned shall be required to divest themselves, on terms\nmutually agreeable to the player and the Team, of any preexisting financial\narrangements between such Team and such player. The foregoing shall\n266\nArticle VII\nnot apply to Compensation earned by the player prior to the assignment\nor to loans.\n(j) As soon as is practicable following each trade (but in no event later\nthan one (1) week from the date of the trade), the NBA shall send to the\nPlayers Association, by email, a summary of the principal terms of the\ntrade; provided, however, that the NBA may omit from such summary any\nterms that the NBA or one (1) or more Teams involved in the trade\nreasonably deem confidential (other than such terms as may be necessary\nto verify the Teams’ compliance with Section 8(a) above).\n(k) A “trade” of a player under this Agreement shall mean an\nassignment of a Player Contract pursuant to a negotiated exchange\nbetween two or more Teams following a trade conference call with the\nNBA league office. For clarity, the word “trade” shall not include an\nassignment of a player via the NBA’s waiver procedures.",

The\nAudit Report shall not be deemed final until the parties have confirmed in\nwriting their agreement (in a form acceptable to the parties) with such\nReport or all disputes with respect to such Report have been finally\nresolved by means of the dispute-resolution procedures provided for by\nthis Agreement.\nIf, at the conclusion of the Audit Report Challenge Period (as defined by\nSection 12(a)(11) below), the Accountants have not submitted or are\nunable to submit a final Audit Report (because, by way of example but not\nlimitation, there are disputes or claims that have been asserted pursuant to\nArticle XXXII, Section 9(c) and which remain pending), the Accountants\nshall prepare and submit to the parties, within five (5) business days\nfollowing the completion of the Audit Report Challenge Period, an\nArticle VII\n269\nInterim Designated Share Audit Report that shall include the information\nset forth in the Interim Audit Report as adjusted or amended so as to\nreflect any final determinations made by the System Arbitrator or the\nAppeals Panel (as the case may be) in proceedings commenced pursuant\nto Article XXXII, Section 9(b) and involving disputes or claims with\nrespect to such Interim Audit Report. The sole purposes for which any\nInterim Designated Share Audit Report is to be used under this Agreement\nare to perform or form the basis for the calculations to be made pursuant\nto Section 12 below and, if applicable, to perform the calculations that\ndetermine whether the conditions to the parties’ mutual termination rights\nset forth in Article XXXIX, Sections 7-8 are satisfied.\n(b) For purposes of determining BRI, Total Salaries and Benefits, and\nthe Designated Share Information, the Accountants shall perform at least\nsuch review procedures as shall be agreed upon by the parties. In\nconnection with the preparation of Audit Reports for each Salary Cap\nYear, each Team and the NBA shall submit a report to the Accountants,\nthe NBA, and the Players Association setting forth BRI, Team Salaries,\nand Benefits information for such Salary Cap Year, on forms agreed upon\nby the NBA, the Players Association, and the Accountants (the “BRI\nReports”). The NBA and the Players Association shall agree upon such\nforms no later than April 1 of each Salary Cap Year.\n(c) The Accountants shall review the reasonableness of any estimates\nof revenues or expenses for a Salary Cap Year included in the Teams’ and\nthe NBA’s BRI Reports for such Salary Cap Year and may make such\nadjustments in such estimates as they deem appropriate. To the extent the\nactual amounts of revenues received or expenses incurred for a Salary Cap\nYear differ from such estimates, adjustments shall be made in BRI for the\nfollowing Salary Cap Year in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 10(f) below.\n(d) With respect to deducted expenses, except for Newly-Deductible\nInternational Expenses, the NBA, League-related entities, Teams, and\nRelated Parties shall report in BRI Reports only those expenses that are\nreasonable and customary in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 1(a) above. Subject to the terms of Section 1(a)(6) and\nSection 1(a)(14) above, and Section 11 below, all categories of expenses\ndeducted in a BRI Report completed by the NBA or a Team shall be\nreviewed by the Accountants, but such categories shall be presumed to be\n270\nArticle VII\nreasonable and customary and the amount of the expenses deducted by\nthe NBA or a Team that come within such expense categories shall also\nbe presumed to be reasonable and customary, unless such categories or\namounts are found by the Accountants to be either unrelated to the\nrevenues involved or grossly excessive.\n(e) The Accountants shall notify designated representatives of the\nNBA and the Players Association: (1) if the Accountants have any\nquestions concerning the amounts of revenues or expenses reported by\nthe Teams and the NBA or any other information contained in the BRI\nReports; or (2) if the Accountants propose that any adjustments be made\nto any revenue or expense item or any other information contained in the\nBRI Reports.\n(f) The Accountants shall indicate which amounts included in BRI for\na Salary Cap Year, if any, represent estimates of revenues or expenses.\nWith respect to any such estimated revenues or expenses, the Accountants\nshall, in preparing the Audit Report for the immediately succeeding Salary\nCap Year (“Subsequent Audit Report”), or the Audit Report for the same\nSalary Cap Year in the event that an Interim Audit Report was previously\nissued for that Salary Cap Year, determine the actual revenues and\nexpenses received for the prior Salary Cap Year and include as a credit or\ndebit to BRI in such Subsequent Audit Report the amount of the aggregate\ndifference, if any, between all such estimated revenues and expenses for\nthe prior Salary Cap Year and the actual revenues and expenses received\nfor such Salary Cap Year.\n(g) In the event that in the course of preparing an Audit Report for a\nSalary Cap Year the Accountants discover that they committed an error in\ncomputing BRI in the Audit Reports for either of the two (2) previous\nSalary Cap Years, which error resulted in a material understatement or\noverstatement of BRI for either of such Salary Cap Years, and the parties\nagree that such error was committed and agree as to the amount of the\nresulting understatement or overstatement (or, if they do not agree, an\nerror (and the amount of such error) is established pursuant to the dispute\nresolution procedures provided for in this Agreement) the amount of such\nunderstatement or overstatement of BRI shall be added to or subtracted\nfrom BRI, as the case may be, with interest (at a rate equal to the one (1)\nyear Treasury Bill rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of\nthe issuance of such Audit Report) accruing from the date of the Audit\nArticle VII\n271\nReport for the Salary Cap Year in which such understatement or\noverstatement occurred in equal annual amounts over the then-current\nand subsequent Salary Cap Years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\nparties will jointly instruct the Accountants that their audits shall not\ninclude procedures specifically designed to detect errors committed in\nprior audits.\n(h) In the event that there is an NHL players’ strike or owners’ lockout\n(“work stoppage”) resulting in the cancellation of all or part of any NHL\nseason in any Salary Cap Year, and such work stoppage results in a refund\nbeing made to luxury suite-holders, premium seat license-holders, or to\npurchasers of fixed arena signage and/or naming rights in arenas in which\nboth an NBA Team and an NHL team plays its home games, then the\nrevenues for luxury suites, premium seat licenses, and fixed arena signage\nand/or naming rights in such arenas shall be determined as if such refunds\nwere not made. If the work stoppage continues for a second year, then\nthe NHL revenues shall be deemed to be the amount included for the\nprior year.\n(i) All disputes with respect to any Interim Audit Report shall be\nresolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in\nArticle XXXII.\n(j) In the event of a trade that (i) occurs after the final Audit Report for\na Salary Cap Year is submitted by the Accountants and before the\nconclusion of such Salary Cap Year, and (ii) results in a player earning a trade\nbonus, the final Audit Report shall be amended to reflect such trade bonus\nfor purposes of calculating such player’s Salary and the Team’s Team Salary\n(and thus, for clarity, for the purposes of computing the amount of tax the\nTeam owes pursuant to Article VII, Section 2(d)); however, the portion of\nsuch trade bonus that is included in the Team’s Team Salary for such Salary\nCap Year shall be excluded from Total Salaries for such Salary Cap Year,\nand included in Total Salaries for the immediately following Salary Cap Year.\nSection 11. Players Association Audit Rights.\n(a) Team Audits. The Players Association shall have the right as part\nof the annual review of BRI Reports to retain its own accountants (the\n“Players Association’s Accountants”), at its own expense, after the\nsubmission of each Audit Report under this Agreement, to audit the books\n272\nArticle VII\nand records of NBA teams (of its choosing), with the number of such audits\nin each Salary Cap Year set forth below (the “First Audit”); provided,\nhowever, that such review shall be limited to (i) revenue items (including in\nrespect of equity transactions subject to Section 1(a)(13) above), and\n(ii) expense items, in each case that appear or should have appeared in the\nBRI Reports. In the event that, in the opinion of the Players Association’s\nAccountants, such audit indicates misallocations or miscategorizations of\nrevenues or expenses (other than with respect to matters that constituted\nDisputed Adjustments in connection with the prior Audit Report) resulting\nin an understatement of BRI, they shall submit to the NBA proposed\nadjustments to BRI consistent with their findings. In the event that the\nNBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments shall\nbe deemed to be “Disputed Adjustments” and shall be resolved in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII. In addition, in\nthe event that First Audit Disputed Adjustments in excess of $8 million are\nresolved in favor of the Players Association, the Players Association shall\nthen have the right, that Season, to have the Players Association’s\nAccountants audit up to an additional ten (10) NBA teams for the same\nSalary Cap Year, in accordance with the foregoing procedures (the “Second\nAudit”). If, as a result of the Second Audit, additional Disputed\nAdjustments in excess of $8 million are resolved in favor of the Players\nAssociation, the Players Association shall then have the right, that Season,\nto have the Players Association’s Accountants audit all remaining NBA\nTeams for that Salary Cap Year. The amount of any and all Disputed\nAdjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the Players Association\nin accordance with this Section 11(a) shall be added to BRI in the Salary Cap\nYear in which such resolution is reached. The aggregate number of NBA\nTeams selected for the First Audit by the Players Association over the course\nof the first six (6) Salary Cap Years of the CBA will be ninety (90), to be\ndistributed over the Salary Cap Years at the Players Association’s option.\nFor the seventh Salary Cap Year of the CBA, the Players Association will be\nentitled to select fifteen (15) NBA Teams for First Audits, supplemented by\nany of the ninety (90) audits that were not used in a previous Salary Cap\nYear.\n(b) League Audit. The Players Association shall have the right as part\nof the annual review of BRI Reports to retain the Players Association’s\nAccountants to conduct an audit, at its own expense, of the books and\nrecords of the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, and other League-related\nentities associated with generating BRI, provided, however, that such audit\nArticle VII\n273\nshall be limited to (i) revenue items (including in respect of equity\ntransactions subject to Section 1(a)(13) above) and (ii) expense items,\nregardless of whether such expenses exceed the applicable BRI ratio of\nexpenses to revenues set forth in Exhibit D, in each case that appear or\nshould have appeared in the BRI Report. In the event that, in the opinion\nof the Players Association’s Accountants, such audit indicates misallocations\nor miscategorizations of revenues or expenses (other than with respect to\nmatters that constituted League Disputed Adjustments in connection with\nthe prior Audit Report) resulting in an understatement of BRI, they shall\nsubmit proposed adjustments to the NBA consistent with their findings. In\nthe event that the NBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed\nadjustments shall be deemed to be League Disputed Adjustments and\nresolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXII. The\namount of any and all such League Disputed Adjustments that are resolved\nin the Players Association’s favor shall be included in BRI in the Salary Cap\nYear in which such resolution is reached. In addition, in the event that any\nsuch League Disputed Adjustments are resolved in the Players Association’s\nfavor, the Accountants shall be directed to correct such expense\nmisallocations and/or miscategorizations in the remaining Salary Cap Years\ncovered by the Agreement.\n(c) Confidentiality. In connection with any audit conducted by the\nPlayers Association pursuant to this Section 11, the Players Association\nagrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a confidentiality\nagreement in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit J-1. The Players\nAssociation also agrees to sign, and to cause its representatives to sign, a\nsimilar confidentiality agreement with respect to information obtained in\nconnection with the Accountants’ audit pursuant to Section 10 above.\n(d) Preceding\nSalary\nCap\nYear\nAudit\nAdjustments.\nNotwithstanding anything else in this Agreement or any release in the annual\nBRI letter agreement, if upward or downward adjustments are made in\nconnection with a Players Association-initiated audit, an adjustment to BRI\nin respect of the same item can also be made for revenues or expenses\nrelated to the preceding Salary Cap Year, if applicable. For example, without\nlimitation, if, based on the audit findings, the parties agree that a Team\nunder-reported 2023-24 BRI by one million dollars ($1,000,000), and that\nthe same error in the same amount occurred in 2022-23, then 2024-25 BRI\nwould be adjusted upward by two million dollars ($2,000,000).\n274\nArticle VII\n(e) Related Party Access. The Players Association’s Accountants\nshall have access to such portions of a Related Party’s books and records\nthat the accountants have a well-founded basis to believe have a meaningful\nimpact on BRI. For purposes of the foregoing, (i) where a team plays in an\narena owned or operated by a Related Party, the Players Association’s\nAccountants will have access to that Related Party arena company’s trial\nbalance relating to all revenues and to such other portions of the trial balance\nthat the Players Association’s Accountants have a well-founded basis to\nbelieve have a meaningful impact on BRI; (ii) for other Related Parties,\ninformation requests should fit the circumstances to enable the Players\nAssociation’s Accountants to verify the accuracy of BRI amounts (x) that\ncannot reasonably be verified through other means, and (y) without\naccessing financial and business information that there is no well-founded\nbasis to believe have a meaningful impact on BRI; and (iii) the NBA, Players\nAssociation, and the Team will collectively consider any request for access\nto Related Party books and records while onsite and make their best efforts\nto resolve the access issue.\n(f) Bilateral Adjustments. Subject to the deadlines set forth in\nSection 11(g) below, the NBA may propose BRI adjustments with respect\nto any Team audited by the Players Association. The NBA’s right to\npropose such adjustments may not adversely affect in any way the time and\nresources available to the Players Association under its audit rights. In the\nevent that the Players Association disputes such proposed adjustments, such\nproposed adjustments shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in Article XXXII. The amount of any and all such proposed\nadjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the NBA in accordance\nwith this Section 11(f), including any adjustments made pursuant to\nSection 11(d) above, shall be deducted from BRI in the Salary Cap Year in\nwhich such resolution is reached.\n(g) Timing. Audits conducted by the Players Association must be\nnoticed within ninety (90) days after issuance of the final Audit Report in\nrespect of the applicable Salary Cap Year. Any proposed adjustments by the\nPlayers Association and NBA relating to Team audits (and in the case of the\nPlayers Association, with respect to any League Office audits) will be\nresolved by April 30 of the following calendar year. Each party will provide\nits proposed adjustments by March 25.\nArticle VII\n275\nSection 12. Designated Share Arrangement.\n(a) Definitions.

and\n(ii) a Team shall be considered financially responsible for any signing\nbonus allocation (or the allocation of any amount treated as a signing\nbonus pursuant to Section 3(b)(1) above) that was the result of a\nsigning bonus (or the result of any amount treated as an earned\nsigning bonus pursuant to Section 3(b)(1) above) paid by the Team.\n(3) “Adjusted Total Benefits” means, with respect to a Salary Cap\nYear, an amount equal to Total Benefits for such Salary Cap Year\nless any amounts reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund\ndescribed in Article IV, Section 6(h) in respect of such Salary Cap\nYear.\n(4) “Adjusted Total Salaries” means, with respect to a Salary Cap\nYear, an amount equal to Total Salaries for such Salary Cap Year\nplus any amounts reimbursed out of the League-wide benefits fund\ndescribed in Article IV, Section 6(h) in respect of such Salary Cap\nYear.\n(5) “Adjusted Total Salaries and Benefits” means, with respect to a\nSalary Cap Year, the sum of Adjusted Total Salaries and Adjusted\nTotal Benefits for such Salary Cap Year.\n276\nArticle VII\n(6) “Adjustment Contract” means, with respect to a Salary Cap\nYear, any Contract that provides for Salary that is included in\nAdjusted Total Salaries for such Salary Cap Year.\n(7) “Adjustment Salary” means, with respect to a Salary Cap Year,\nthe amount of Salary in respect of an Adjustment Contract that is\nincluded in Adjusted Total Salaries for such Salary Cap Year.\n(8) “Adjustment Schedules” means the schedules prepared by the\nNBA with respect to each Salary Cap Year in advance of each\nsemi-monthly payment date setting forth for each player the\napplicable Compensation adjustment to be applied in respect of the\napplicable Compensation payment.\n(9) “Aggregate Reduction Amount” means, with respect to a Salary\nCap Year, an amount equal to the sum of the Contract Reduction\nAmounts for all Adjustment Contracts for such Salary Cap Year.\n(10) “Aggregate Team Overage Balance” means, with respect to a\nSalary Cap Year, an amount equal to the sum of all Team Overage\nBalances for such Salary Cap Year.\n(11) “Audit Report Challenge Period” means the period beginning\nwith the date on which an Interim Audit Report is issued by the\nAccountants and ending on the last date by which all challenges\nthereto brought pursuant to Article XXXII, Section 9(b) are\nresolved.\n(12) “Carryover Amount” means, with respect to a Salary Cap Year,\n(i) the amount, if any, by which the Uncapped Reduction Amount\nin respect of the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year exceeded\nthe Aggregate Reduction Amount in respect of such immediately\npreceding Salary Cap Year, less (ii) the amount, if any, by which the\nShortfall Amount for the immediately preceding Salary Cap Year\nexceeded the amount distributed to players pursuant to\nSection 12(e)(3) below with respect to such immediately preceding\nSalary Cap Year.\n(13) “Carryover Interest Rate” means, with respect to a Salary Cap\nYear, a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as\nArticle VII\n277\npublished in The Wall Street Journal on the first day of such Salary Cap\nYear, plus 1.225%.\n(14) “Contract Reduction Amount” means for an Adjustment\nContract, with respect to a Salary Cap Year:\n(i)\nPrior to the completion of the Governing Audit Report: an\namount equal to the Adjustment Salary in respect of such\nAdjustment Contract for such Salary Cap Year multiplied by\nthe Withholding Percentage;

In the event any amount remains outstanding as of\nthe first semi-monthly payment date for the immediately following\nSalary Cap Year, such outstanding amount shall be subtracted from\nthe Contract Reduction Amount for such Adjustment Contract in\nrespect of the Salary Cap Year with respect to which such amount\nremains outstanding (and the parties shall adjust (or, if necessary,\ndeem amended) the Governing Audit Report to reflect such\ndecrease).\n(4) Within seven (7) days after receiving any set of Adjustment\nSchedules from the NBA, or within seven (7) days after any event\nthat the Players Association believes warrants a change in any\npreviously-issued Adjustment Schedules, the Players Association\nmay bring a proceeding before the System Arbitrator, in accordance\nwith Article XXXII, Section 10, contesting the NBA’s calculation of\nany player’s Compensation adjustment pursuant to this\nSection 12(c). Notwithstanding the commencement of any such\nproceeding, each Team shall continue making Compensation\n282\nArticle VII\nadjustments in accordance with this Section 12(c), and in no event\nshall any Team be prohibited from making such Compensation\nadjustments prior to a final determination in any such proceeding.\nIn the event that the NBA makes a determination, or a final\ndetermination is made in a proceeding in accordance with this\nSection 12(c)(4), that an adjustment to a player’s Compensation was\nerroneously calculated by the NBA, the sole remedy with respect to\nany amounts erroneously deducted from the player’s Compensation\nshall be to modify, as soon as practicable, the deduction amounts\napplicable to such player so as to reduce, in equal amounts, all\nscheduled future deductions from post-determination payments of\nCompensation until the amount of any prior over-deduction is fully\noffset; provided, however, that to the extent that reducing the\nplayer’s future deductions would not fully offset the prior\nover-deductions, the NBA shall instruct the applicable Team to pay\nthe player as soon as practicable such additional amounts as are\nnecessary to fully offset such over-deductions.\n(d) Team Overage Balance. In respect of each Salary Cap Year, each\nTeam’s Team Overage Balance shall (prior to any adjustments made in\naccordance with Section 12(e) below) equal:\n(1) If there is an Overage Amount that is less than or equal to ten\npercent (10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries: the Overage Amount\ndivided by thirty (30).\n(2) If there is an Overage Amount that is greater than ten percent\n(10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries: an amount equal to the sum of\n(i) ten percent (10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries divided by\nthirty (30), and (ii) the amount by which the Overage exceeds ten\npercent (10%) of Adjusted Total Salaries, multiplied by a fraction,\nthe numerator of which is the Team’s Adjusted Team Salary for such\nSalary Cap Year, and the denominator of which is Adjusted Total\nSalaries for such Salary Cap Year.\n(3) If the Overage Amount is zero (0): zero (0).\n(e) Allocation of Distribution Amount. Each Salary Cap Year, as part\nof the Governing Audit Report, the following processes will apply with\nArticle VII\n283\nrespect to Team Overage Balances and the Distribution Amount for such\nSalary Cap Year (the “Distribution Year”):\n(1) Beginning with the earliest Salary Cap Year in respect of which\nthe Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than zero (0):\n(i)\nIf the Distribution Year is later than such Salary Cap Year,\nthen each Team’s Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year shall be increased by an amount equal to its\nTeam Overage Balance in respect of such Salary Cap Year\nmultiplied by the Carryover Interest Rate in respect of the\nDistribution Year (and thus the Aggregate Team Overage\nBalance in respect of such Salary Cap Year shall be increased\nby the sum of the increase to each Team’s Team Overage\nBalance in accordance with this Section 12(e)(1)(i)); and\n(ii)\nWith respect to such Salary Cap Year, the Distribution\nAmount for the Distribution Year shall be allocated as\nfollows:\n(A)\nIf the Distribution Amount is greater than or equal\nto the Aggregate Team Overage Balance in respect\nof such Salary Cap Year, each Team shall be\nallocated a portion of the Distribution Amount\nequal to its Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year. As a result, each Team’s Team\nOverage Balance in respect of such Salary Cap Year\n(and thus the Aggregate Team Overage Balance in\nrespect of such Salary Cap Year) shall be reduced to\nzero (0); or\n(B)\nIf the Distribution Amount is less than the\nAggregate Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year, each Team shall be allocated a\nportion of the Distribution Amount in proportion\nto its Team Overage Balance in respect of such\nSalary Cap Year. As a result, each Team’s Team\nOverage Balance in respect of such Salary Cap Year\nshall be reduced by its respective allocated amount\n(and thus the Aggregate Team Overage Balance in\n284\nArticle VII\nrespect of such Salary Cap Year shall be reduced by\nthe sum of such allocated amounts).\n(2) The process described in Section 12(e)(1) above shall then be\nrepeated, in chronological order, for each successive Salary Cap Year\nfor which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than\nzero (0), utilizing the portion of the Distribution Amount for the\nDistribution Year that has not yet been allocated to Teams in respect\nof an earlier Salary Cap Year.\n(3) If, as a result of the existence of a Shortfall Amount for the\nDistribution Year and following the procedures described in\nSections 12(e)(1)-(2) above, the portion of the Distribution Amount\nthat has not been allocated to Teams is greater than zero (0), such\nunallocated portion of the Distribution Amount shall then be\nallocated to each player in proportion to the Adjustment Salary\nprovided for by his Adjustment Contract(s) (as a percentage of\nAdjusted Total Salaries) for the Distribution Year. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, if the portion of the Distribution Amount to be\nallocated to players pursuant to this Section 12(e)(3) in respect of the\nDistribution Year exceeds the Aggregate Reduction Amount in\nrespect of such Salary Cap Year, then such excess, rather than being\nallocated to each player in proportion to the Adjustment Salary\nprovided for by his Adjustment Contract(s), shall be allocated to\neach player on such proportional basis as may be reasonably\ndetermined by the Players Association.\nExample: Assume (i) as set forth in the Governing Audit Report for the 2024-25\nSalary Cap Year (i.e., the Distribution Year), the 2024-25 Distribution Amount is\n$500 million, and (ii) prior to any allocations of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount\npursuant to this Section 12(e), there is a 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance\nof $200 million and a 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $400 million,\nand (iii) the 2024-25 Carryover Interest Rate is five percent (5%).\nThe earliest Salary Cap Year in which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater\nthan zero (0) is the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year. Because the 2024-25 Distribution\nYear is later than the 2023-24 Salary Cap Year, each Team’s 2023-24 Team\nOverage Balance (and hence the 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance) would\nbe increased by five percent (5%) (i.e., the 2024-25 Carryover Interest Rate). As a\nArticle VII\n285\nresult of such increase, the 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be $210\nmillion (i.e., $200 million increased by five percent (5%)).\nThe 2024-25 Distribution Amount of $500 million is greater than the 2023-24\nAggregate Team Overage Balance of $210 million. Accordingly, $210 million of the\n2024-25 Distribution Amount would be allocated to Teams in amounts equal to each\nTeam’s 2023-24 Team Overage Balance. As a result of such allocation, each Team’s\n2023-24 Team Overage Balance (and hence the 2023-24 Aggregate Team Overage\nBalance) would be zero (0).\nThe next Salary Cap Year in which the Aggregate Team Overage Balance is greater\nthan zero (0) is the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year. The Distribution Year is not later\nthan the 2024-25 Salary Cap Year and thus neither each Team’s 2024-25 Team\nOverage Balance nor the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be\nincreased pursuant to Section 12(e)(1)(i) above.\nThe unallocated portion of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount is $290 million ($500\nmillion less the $210 million amount that was allocated in respect of the 2023-24\nSalary Cap Year), which is less than the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance\nof $400 million. Accordingly, $290 million of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount\nwould be allocated to Teams in proportion to each Team’s 2024-25 Team Overage\nBalance. As a result of such allocation, each Team’s 2024-25 Team Overage Balance\nwould be decreased by its respective allocation of the 2024-25 Distribution Amount\n(and hence the 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance would be reduced by $290\nmillion), resulting in a 2024-25 Aggregate Team Overage Balance of $110 million\n($400 million less the $290 million amount allocated from the 2024-25 Distribution\nAmount).\nIn accordance with Section 12(e)(3) above, no portion of the 2024-25 Distribution\nAmount would be allocated to players in respect of 2024-25 Adjustment Contracts.\n(f) Team Reconciliation Payments. The NBA shall facilitate the\nfollowing payments to be made within sixty (60) days following the\ncompletion of the Governing Audit Report in respect of each Salary Cap\nYear, based on the allocations described in Section 12(e) above. Each Team\nshall be entitled to receive or, if the result of the following calculation is\n286\nArticle VII\nnegative for such Team, required to pay, the following amount in respect of\na Salary Cap Year:\n(1) The sum of: (i) the total Distribution Amount allocated to the\nTeam in accordance with Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above; and (ii) the\nportion of the Distribution Amount allocated in accordance with\nSection 12(e)(3) above to each player in respect of an Adjustment\nContract for which the Team is (or was) the last Team responsible\nfor making payments to the player in respect of the Season\nencompassed by the Salary Cap Year for which the Governing Audit\nReport was just completed; less\n(2) The sum of: (i) the total amount by which such Team reduced\n(or is scheduled to reduce) Compensation payments to players in\nrespect of the Season encompassed by such Salary Cap Year\npursuant to Section 12(c) above; and (ii) the Shortfall Amount (if\nany) in respect of such Salary Cap Year divided by the number of\nTeams that played in the NBA during such Salary Cap Year.\n(g) Player Reconciliation Payments. Following completion of the\nGoverning Audit Report in respect of each Salary Cap Year, each player to\nwhom a portion of the Distribution Amount is allocated in accordance with\nSection 12(e)(3) above shall be paid the amount of such allocation in respect\nof an Adjustment Contract by the final Team responsible for making\npayments to such player pursuant to such Adjustment Contract in respect\nof the Salary Cap Year for which the Governing Audit Report was just\ncompleted. Such payment shall be made to the player in equal installments\nover the remaining semi-monthly dates on which payments are due to the\nplayer for the applicable Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract\nbeginning with either the next semi-monthly payment date following the\nissuance of the Governing Audit Report or, if practicability warrants, the\nsecond semi-monthly payment date following the issuance of the Governing\nAudit Report (or, if there are no remaining payments due to the player for\nsuch Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract, in one (1) payment to be\nmade within sixty (60) days following the completion of the Governing\nAudit Report).\n(h) Survival of Obligation and Terms. In the event that, upon the\nexpiration or termination of this Agreement, there is an Aggregate Team\nOverage Balance in respect of any Salary Cap Year (including the final Salary\nArticle VII\n287\nCap Year of this Agreement) that is greater than zero (0), the sum total of\nany Aggregate Team Overage Balances shall be due and owing by the players\nto the Teams and shall be recouped in full by the Teams under a successor\ncollective bargaining agreement via reductions to the Compensation\notherwise payable to players (i) no later than the Salary Cap Years in which\nsuch Aggregate Team Overage Balances would have been recouped\npursuant to this Section 12 had these provisions continued in effect, and\n(ii) using the method described in this Section 12 or such other method as\nis mutually agreed by the parties. Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Agreement, the terms of this Section 12(h) shall survive the expiration\nor termination of this Agreement. For clarity, nothing in this Section 12(h)\nshall impact any right to engage in any strikes, lockouts, or cessations or\nother stoppages of work following the expiration or termination of this\nAgreement.\n(i) Information to Be Included in Audit Report. The parties shall\ncause the Accountants to include in the Interim Audit Report and the\nGoverning Audit Report for each Salary Cap Year schedules setting forth,\nwith respect to such Salary Cap Year:\n(1) BRI, the Designated Share, Total Salaries and Benefits, and\nAdjusted Total Salaries and Benefits;\n(2) the Overage Amount or the Shortfall Amount (as applicable);\n(3) the Actual Reduction Percentage;\n(4) the Aggregate Reduction Amount;\n(5) the Distribution Amount;\n(6) the Aggregate Team Overage Balance and each Team’s Team\nOverage Balance, both before and after the application of\nSections 12(e)(1)-(2) above;\n(7) for each prior Salary Cap Year in respect of which the\nAggregate Team Overage Balance is greater than zero (0) prior to\nthe application of Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above, the Aggregate Team\nOverage Balance and each Team’s Team Overage Balance in respect\nof each such prior Salary Cap Year, both before and after the\napplication of Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above;\n288\nArticle VII\n(8) a listing of each Team and the Distribution Amount allocated\nto each such Team in accordance with Sections 12(e)(1)-(2) above;\n(9) a listing of each Adjustment Contract, the associated Contract\nReduction Amount, and the Distribution Amount allocated to the\nplayer in respect of such Adjustment Contract in accordance with\nSection 12(e)(3) above;\n(10) a summary of the reconciliation payments described in\nSections 12(f)-(g) above;\n(11) the amount (if any) by which each Team’s Tax Team Salary (as\ncomputed pursuant to Section 2(d) above) exceeds the Tax Level,\nand the resulting tax payment due by the Team;\n(12) the amount (if any) of any Minimum Team Salary payment\nowed by a team in accordance with Section 2(c) above; and\n(13) the amount (if any) by which each Team’s Apron Team Salary\n(as computed pursuant to Section 2(e) above) exceeds the Second\nApron Level.\n(j)\nMiscellaneous.\n(1) For all purposes under this Agreement, the computation of a\nplayer’s Salary or Adjustment Salary shall be made without regard to\nany adjustment made (or to be made) to such player’s Compensation\nin accordance with this Section 12.\n(2) When (i) pursuant to Article VI, Section 1 or Article XLI,\nSection 4(e), a player has forfeited a portion of his Compensation\nfor a Season (payable to him pursuant to an Adjustment Contract)\n(the “forfeited amount”) and (ii) following the completion of the\nGoverning Audit Report, the Contract Reduction Amount for such\nAdjustment Contract for the applicable Salary Cap Year is greater\nthan zero (0), then the player shall be entitled to a refund of a portion\nof the forfeited amount. The refund shall be in an amount equal to\nthe Contract Reduction Amount for the Adjustment Contract for\nthe Salary Cap Year to which the forfeited amount related multiplied\nby a fraction, the numerator of which is the forfeited amount, and\nthe denominator of which is the player’s Base Compensation for\nArticle VII\n289\nsuch Season pursuant to the Adjustment Contract as of the date(s)\nthe Compensation was forfeited. For clarity, the amount of the\nrefund shall be less all amounts required to be withheld by any\ngovernmental authority. For purposes of the foregoing calculation,\na player’s Contract Reduction Amount shall be deemed to include\nonly the portion of the player’s Contract Reduction Amount that\nrelates to the Base Compensation for the applicable Season set forth\nin the applicable Adjustment Contract. Such refund shall be made\nto the player within sixty (60) days following the completion of the\nGoverning Audit Report for the Salary Cap Year in which the\nforfeited amount is collected.\n290\nArticle VIII",

    "content": "Rookie Scale Contracts for First Round Picks.\n(a) Each Rookie Scale Contract between a Team and a First Round Pick\nshall cover a period of two (2) Seasons, but shall have an Option in favor of\nthe Team for the player’s third Season and a second Option in favor of the\nTeam for the player’s fourth Season. The Option for the player’s third\nSeason shall be exercisable during the period from the day following the last\nday of the first Season through the immediately following October 31. The\nOption for the player’s fourth Season shall be exercisable during the period\nfrom the day following the last day of the second Season through the\nimmediately following October 31. (For clarity, consistent with the rule set\nforth in Article XLII, Section 2, if October 31 in any year falls on a Saturday,\nSunday, or Federal Holiday, then the deadline for exercising Options in\nRookie Scale Contracts shall be deemed to fall on the following business\nday.) Such Options shall be exercisable by notice to the player that is either\npersonally delivered to the player or his representative or sent by email or\npre-paid certified, registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of\nthe player or his representative, signed by the Team, informing the player\nthat the Team has exercised such Option.\n(b) (i)\nThe Rookie Salary Scale applicable to a First Round Pick is\ndetermined by the first Season to be covered by the player’s\nRookie Scale Contract. Accordingly, for example, if a\nplayer’s Rookie Scale Contract commences with the 2023-24\nSeason, the 2023-24 Rookie Salary Scale shall apply. Within\na particular Rookie Salary Scale, a First Round Pick’s\napplicable Rookie Scale Amounts are determined by the\nplayer’s selection number in the NBA Draft. Accordingly,\nfor example, the Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to the\neighth player selected in the first round of the NBA Draft\nshall be those specified in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale\nfor the eighth pick. Notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in this Section 1(b)(i) or in Section 1(b)(ii) below,\nbeginning on January 10 of each Season, an unsigned First\nRound Pick’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount for such\nSeason shall be reduced daily through the end of the Regular\nArticle VIII\n291\nSeason by an amount equal to the applicable Rookie Scale\nAmount (as set forth in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale)\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1)\nand the denominator of which is the total number of days in\nsuch Regular Season.\n(ii)\nNotwithstanding Section 1(b)(i) above, if, pursuant to any\nprovision of this Agreement or the NBA Constitution and\nBy-Laws, one (1) or more Teams is required to forfeit\none (1) or more draft picks in the first round of a particular\nNBA Draft, then:\n(A)\nthe Rookie Salary Scale for the Salary Cap Year\nimmediately following such Draft (or the Salary Cap\nYear of such Draft if the Draft occurs on or after\nJuly 1) shall be adjusted by removing one (1) or more\nRookie Scale Amounts from the middle of the\nRookie Salary Scale, as follows: if one (1) first round\npick is forfeited, then the Rookie Scale Amounts that\nwould have been applicable to the 15th player\nselected in the first round (absent any forfeiture of\npicks) (hereinafter, the “15th Pick”) shall be\nremoved from the Rookie Salary Scale; if two (2) first\nround picks are forfeited, then the Rookie Scale\nAmounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the pick\nimmediately following the 15th Pick shall be\nremoved from the Rookie Salary Scale; if three (3)\nfirst round picks are forfeited, then the Rookie Scale\nAmounts applicable to the 15th Pick and the picks\nimmediately preceding and immediately following\nthe 15th Pick shall be removed from the Rookie\nSalary Scale; and if more than three picks are\nforfeited, additional Rookie Scale Amounts shall be\nremoved from the Rookie Salary Scale in accordance\nwith the foregoing procedure; and\n(B)\nthe Rookie Scale Amounts applicable to players\nselected in such Draft shall be determined by their\nselection number under the Rookie Salary Scale as\nadjusted by Section 1(b)(ii)(A) above. Accordingly,\n292\nArticle VIII\nfor example, if one First Round Pick were forfeited\nin the first round of the 2024 Draft, the applicable\nRookie Scale Amounts would remain unchanged for\nthe first 14 picks, and the Rookie Scale Amounts\napplicable to the remaining 15 picks in the first\nround would be the Rookie Scale Amounts that\n(absent any forfeiture of picks) would have been\napplicable to picks 16 through 30.\n(c) (i)\nA Rookie Scale Contract shall provide in each of the two (2)\nSeasons covered by the Contract and the first Option Year\nfor Current Base Compensation of at least the greater of:\n(A) eighty percent (80%) of the applicable Rookie Scale\nAmount, and (B) the player’s applicable Minimum Player\nSalary. Components of Salary in excess of the foregoing\namount, if any, are subject to individual negotiation, except\nthat (1) in no event may Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for any\nSalary Cap Year exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%)\nof the applicable Rookie Scale Amount, and (2) a Rookie\nScale Contract may not provide for a signing bonus (except\nfor an “international player” payment in excess of the\nExcluded International Player Payment Amount made in\naccordance with Article VII, Section 3(e)) or a loan. A\nRookie Scale Contract may provide for a payment schedule\nin any Season that is more favorable to the player than that\ncalled for under Paragraph 3 of the Uniform Player\nContract, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.\n(ii)\nA Rookie Scale Contract must provide for Compensation\nprotection for lack of skill and injury or illness in each of the\ntwo (2) Seasons covered by the Contract and the first Option\nYear of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the applicable\nRookie Scale Amount. To the extent permitted by Article\nII, Section 4(l), a Team and a First Round Pick may negotiate\nadditional conditions or limitations applicable to the player’s\nBase Compensation protection, except that lack of skill and\ninjury or illness protection of at least eighty percent (80%)\nof the applicable Rookie Scale Amount in each of the first\ntwo (2) Seasons and the first Option Year shall contain no\nArticle VIII\n293\nsuch individually-negotiated additional conditions or\nlimitations.\n(iii)\nThe terms and conditions (other than with respect to the\npayment schedule for the player’s Base Compensation) that\napply to the second Option Year shall be unchanged from\nall terms and conditions that applied to the first Option Year\n(including, but not limited to, the percentage of Base\nCompensation that is protected), except that the Salary\n(excluding Incentive Compensation) and, if the Rookie Scale\nContract provides for Incentive Compensation for the first\nOption Year, then the amount of each bonus, for the second\nOption Year shall be increased over the Salary (excluding\nIncentive Compensation) and amount of each bonus,\nrespectively, for the first Option Year by the applicable\npercentage specified in the applicable Rookie Salary Scale.\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a trade\nof a Rookie Scale Contract would, by reason of a trade bonus contained in\nsuch Contract, cause the player’s Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for the Salary\nCap Year in which such trade occurs to exceed one hundred twenty\npercent (120%) of the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount for such\nSalary Cap Year, such player’s trade bonus shall be deemed amended to the\nextent necessary to reduce the player’s Salary plus Unlikely Bonuses for such\nSalary Cap Year to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the applicable\nRookie Scale Amount.",

If the Offer Sheet provides\nfor Salary for the third Salary Cap Year in accordance with\nthe foregoing sentence, then, subject to Section 5(d)(iii)\nbelow, (A) the player’s Salary for the fourth Salary Cap Year\nmay increase or decrease in relation to the third Salary Cap\nYear’s Salary by no more than four and five tenths\npercent (4.5%) of the Salary for the third Salary Cap Year,\n(B) the Offer Sheet cannot contain bonuses of any kind, and\n(C) the Offer Sheet must provide for one hundred\npercent (100%) of the Base Compensation in each Season to\nbe protected for lack of skill and injury or illness (with no\nindividually-negotiated conditions or limitations on such\nprotection).\n(iii)\nIf a Team extends an Offer Sheet in accordance with\nSection 5(d)(ii) above, then, for purposes of determining\nwhether the Team has Room for the Offer Sheet, the Salary\nfor the first Salary Cap Year covered by the Offer Sheet shall\nbe deemed to equal the average of the aggregate Salaries for\n324\nArticle XI\nsuch Salary Cap Year and each subsequent Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the Offer Sheet. If the ROFR Team does not\nexercise its Right of First Refusal, the player’s Salary for each\nSalary Cap Year covered by the Contract with the Team that\nextended the Offer Sheet shall be deemed to equal the\naverage of the aggregate Salaries for each such Salary Cap\nYear. If the ROFR Team exercises its Right of First Refusal,\nthe player’s Salary for each Salary Cap Year covered by the\nContract with the ROFR Team shall be the Salary for such\nSalary Cap Year as set forth in the Contract.\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the sum of (A)\nthe ROFR Team’s Team Salary at the time it exercises its\nRight of First Refusal, and (B) the average of the aggregate\nSalaries for each Salary Cap Year of the Offer Sheet, is less\nthan or equal to the Salary Cap for the then-current Salary\nCap Year, then the ROFR Team may, in connection with\nexercising its Right of First Refusal, elect to have the player’s\nSalary for each Salary Cap Year covered by the Contract\nequal the average of such aggregate Salaries for each such\nSalary Cap Year. If the ROFR Team wishes to make such\nan election, it must do so by providing the NBA with a\nwritten statement on the same day that it gives the First\nRefusal Exercise Notice to the Restricted Free Agent and\nNew Team pursuant to Section 5(t) below, and the NBA\nshall provide a copy of this notice to the Players Association\nwithin one (1) business day following its receipt thereof.\n(e) The Principal Terms of an Offer Sheet are only:\n(i)\nthe term of the Contract;\n(ii)\nthe fixed and specified Compensation that the New Team\nwill pay or lend to the Restricted Free Agent as a signing\nbonus, Current Base Compensation, and/or Deferred Base\nCompensation in specified installments on specified dates;\n(iii)\nIncentive Compensation; provided, however, that the only\nelements of such Incentive Compensation that shall be\nincluded in the Principal Terms are the following:\n(A) bonuses that qualify as Likely Bonuses based upon the\nArticle XI\n325\nperformance of the Team extending the Offer Sheet and the\nROFR Team; and (B) Generally Recognized League\nHonors; and\n(iv)\nAny allowable amendments to the terms contained in the\nUniform Player Contract (e.g., Base Compensation\nprotection, a trade bonus, etc.).\n(f) In the event that an Offer Sheet includes an Exhibit 6 requiring that\nthe player pass a physical examination to be performed by a physician\ndesignated by the New Team, the Exhibit 6 language must be replaced with\nthe following: “This Offer Sheet will be deemed invalid and of no force and\neffect (except as described in Article XI, Section 5(l) of the CBA) unless the\nplayer passes, in the sole discretion of the Team (exercised in good faith), a\nphysical examination in accordance with Article II, Section 13(h) of the CBA\nthat is (i) conducted within two (2) days of the execution of this Offer Sheet,\nand (ii) the results of which are reported by the Team to the player within\nthree (3) days of the execution of this Offer Sheet. The player agrees to\nsupply complete and truthful information in connection with any such\nexaminations.” The New Team must notify the player and the ROFR Team\nwithin the three (3)-day period set forth in the Exhibit 6 in the Offer Sheet\nwhether the player has passed the physical. In the event that the New Team\nfails to timely provide such notice, the player shall be deemed to have passed\nthe physical with the New Team.\n(g) If the ROFR Team gives to the Restricted Free Agent a “First\nRefusal Exercise Notice” substantially in the form of Exhibit H annexed\nhereto (i) for an Offer Sheet received by the ROFR Team prior to 12:00 p.m.\neastern time on a day, by 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the day immediately\nfollowing such day, or (ii) for an Offer Sheet received by the ROFR Team\non or after 12:00 p.m. eastern time on a day, by 11:59 p.m. eastern time on\nthe day that is two (2) days following such day, then, subject to Section 5(k)\nbelow, such Restricted Free Agent and the ROFR Team shall be deemed to\nhave entered into a Player Contract containing all the Principal Terms (but\nnot any terms other than the Principal Terms) included in the Uniform\nPlayer Contract attached to the Offer Sheet (except that if the Contract\ncontains an Exhibit 6, such Exhibit 6 shall be deemed deleted).

Even with the player’s consent,\nfor one (1) year, neither the ROFR Team exercising its Right of First Refusal\nnor any other Team may trade the player to the Team whose Offer Sheet\nwas matched.\n(k)\n(i)\nAny Team may condition its First Refusal Exercise Notice\non the player reporting for and passing, in the sole discretion\nof the Team (exercised in good faith), a physical examination\nto be conducted by a physician designated by the Team\nwithin two (2) days from its exercise of the Right of First\nRefusal. In connection with the physical examination, the\nplayer must supply all information reasonably requested of\nhim, provide complete and truthful answers to all questions\nposed to him, and submit to all examinations and tests\nrequested of him.\n(ii)\nIf the player does not submit to the requested physical\nexamination within two (2) days of the exercise of the Right\nof First Refusal, then the First Refusal Exercise Notice shall\nbe deemed no longer to be conditioned on the player\nArticle XI\n327\nreporting for and passing a physical examination and the\nfollowing rules shall apply:\n(1) In its sole discretion, the ROFR Team shall have two (2)\ndays following the conclusion of the two (2) day period\nreferenced in Section 5(k)(i) above to withdraw its First\nRefusal Exercise Notice.

Upon conclusion of its review, the Panel\nshall provide a report to the NBA, the player’s Team, and\nthe Players Association setting forth its determination and\nthe reasons therefor.\n(2)\nThe determination to be made by the Panel is whether, in\nthe Panel’s reasonable medical judgment and experience,\nand having considered current medical knowledge and the\nbest available objective evidence: (i) the player is medically\nable and medically fit to perform his duties as a professional\nbasketball player; and (ii) performing such duties would not\ncreate a materially elevated risk of death, paralysis, or other\npermanent spinal injury for the player. Where there are\nauthoritative medical guidelines on fitness for athletic\nparticipation and a particular injury, illness, or other medical\ncondition (e.g., the American Heart Association/American\nCollege of Cardiology Scientific Statements on Eligibility\nand Disqualification – Recommendations for Competitive\n390\nArticle XXII\nAthletes with Cardiovascular Abnormalities), the Panel will\nconsider such guidelines in making its determination.\n(3)\nSubsequent to the player being referred to a Fitness-to-Play\nPanel, and prior to the Panel’s review of the player’s injury,\nillness, or other medical condition, the player (on behalf of\nhimself, his heirs, and assigns) shall be required to sign a\nrelease and covenant not to sue agreement in the form\nagreed upon by the parties; provided that this agreement\nshall not apply to any claim of medical malpractice against a\nTeam-affiliated physician or any physician retained by the\nNBA or Players Association for the medical evaluation\nprocess.\n(e) In the event that the Fitness-to-Play Panel determines that the player\nis medically able and medically fit to play professional basketball pursuant\nto the standard in subsection (d) above: (i) the player will be required to sign\nan informed consent and assumption of risk agreement in the form agreed\nupon by the parties before he is able to play or practice in the NBA; and\n(ii) upon satisfying the prior clause, shall be deemed at that time medically\nable and fit to play basketball in the NBA and permitted to do so.\n(f) If the Fitness-to-Play Panel does not determine that the player is\nmedically able and medically fit to play professional basketball pursuant to\nthe standard in subsection (d) above, the NBA, a Team, or the Players\nAssociation may again refer the player to the Fitness-to-Play Panel beginning\non the later of the first day of the Season that begins immediately following\nthe date on which the Panel issued its report or nine (9) months after such\ndate. The party making such referral must have been advised in writing by\na physician that there have been materially changed circumstances since the\nPanel issued its report (e.g., medical advances or a material change in the\nplayer’s medical condition) such that the Panel should reconsider its\ndetermination. If a player is referred under this subsection (f), the\nFitness-to-Play Panel shall be comprised of the same members that reviewed\nand determined the player’s initial referral, provided that the physicians on\nsuch panel are available.\n(g) Nothing in this Section 11 shall obligate a Team to permit a player\nto play or practice for the Team, even if a Fitness-to-Play Panel determines\nthat the player is medically able to do so. If the Team disagrees with the\nArticle XXII\n391\nFitness-to-Play Panel’s conclusion and refuses to permit the player to play\nand practice with the Team due to the injury, illness, or other medical\ncondition for which the player was referred to the Fitness-to-Play Panel,\nthen the Team will be required, within sixty (60) days of the Panel’s issuance\nof its report (or, if the report is issued during the period from the date that\nis sixty (60) days prior to the date of the NBA trade deadline through May\n31, then by August 1) (the “Evaluation Period”), to either trade the player,\nagree to amend the player’s Contract in accordance with Article II,\nSection 3(p) of the CBA, waive the player pursuant to Paragraph 16 of the\nUniform Player Contract, or waive the player pursuant to the “Partial Waiver\nProcedure” described in Section 11(i) below (a “Partial Waiver”); provided,\nhowever, that the foregoing shall not apply to any player who is in the last\nyear of his Contract (excluding any Option Year) at the time that the Panel\nprovides its report to the NBA, the player’s Team, and the Players\nAssociation pursuant to Section 11(d)(1) above. During the Evaluation\nPeriod, the player, shall cooperate with the Team in connection with the\nTeam’s efforts to evaluate the player’s injury, illness, or other medical\ncondition, including by, among other things, in a prompt and diligent\nmanner supplying all information requested of him, completing medical\nforms, and submitting to all examinations, tests, and workouts requested of\nhim by or on behalf of the Team.\n(h) If a player referred to a Fitness-to-Play Panel satisfies the waiting\nperiod set forth in Article VII, Section 4(h)(1) of the CBA at the time of\nsuch referral (or any time thereafter prior to the Panel issuing its report),\nthen the Team may request that such Panel, acting by majority vote, also\nserve as the physician described in Article VII, Section 4(h)(2) of the CBA,\nand accordingly provide in the Panel’s report a determination for the\npurposes of Article VII, Section 4(h) of the CBA.\n(i) In order for an eligible Team, pursuant to Section 11(g) above, to\ndesignate an eligible player’s Contract for a Partial Waiver, the Team must\nprovide written notice of such waiver and designation to the NBA. Once a\nTeam duly invokes the Partial Waiver Procedure, such procedure shall\noperate as follows:\n(i)\nThe waiver period shall be the same as the period for other\nwaivers.\n392\nArticle XXII\n(ii)\nAny Team other than the Team requesting the waiver may\nsubmit either a Full Waiver Claim or a Partial Waiver Claim\nfor the player. A “Full Waiver Claim” is a claim for the full\nvalue of the remaining term of the Contract pursuant to\nSection 5 of the NBA By-Laws. A “Partial Waiver Claim” is\na discount bid of a specified dollar amount (rounded to the\nnearest dollar) for a portion of the value of the remaining\nterm of the Contract. A Partial Waiver Claim can be for any\namount equal to or greater than the total of the applicable\nMinimum Player Salary for all of the Remaining Protected\nYears (as defined below) of the Contract and less than the\ntotal of the full Base Compensation provided for in all of the\nRemaining Protected Years of the Contract, provided that a\nPartial Waiver Claim may never be less than the total of the\nunprotected Base Compensation provided for in all of the\nRemaining Protected Years of the Contract. A “Remaining\nProtected Year” means any remaining year of the Contract\nthat contains any amount of Base Compensation protection\nthat is not contingent on some event occurring on a date\nafter the request for waivers; any remaining years of the\nContract that are not Remaining Protected Years shall\nhereinafter be referred to as “Remaining Unprotected\nYears.” For clarity, any Player Option Year in which the\nContract includes the language in Article XII, Section\n2(a)(A) and the Effective Season of an ETO shall be a\nRemaining Protected Year, and any Player Option Year in\nwhich the Contract that includes the language in Article XII,\nSection 2(a)(B) and any Team Option Year shall be a\nRemaining Unprotected Year.\n(iii)\nIn order to submit a Partial Waiver Claim, the Team must\nhave a Team Salary below the Salary Cap and room equal to\nat least the portion of the Claiming Team Base\nCompensation Obligation (as defined in subsection (vi)(A)\nbelow) plus any Likely Bonuses applicable to the first Year\nof the Remaining Protected Years of the Contract. For\npurposes of the preceding sentence, “room” includes room\nthat can be unilaterally created by the claiming Team (e.g., via\nrenouncements or waivers, but not via trades) and such\nArticle XXII\n393\nroom must be created immediately upon the awarding of the\nplayer pursuant to this waiver procedure.\n(iv)\nIf at least one (1) Full Waiver Claim is submitted during the\nwaiver period, the Contract shall be awarded to the Team\nsubmitting a Full Waiver Claim that is entitled to the highest\norder of preference in accordance with the waiver\nprocedures set forth in the NBA Constitution and By-Laws.\nIf no Full Waiver Claim is submitted and at least one (1)\nPartial Waiver Claim is submitted, the Contract shall be\nawarded to the Team submitting the highest Partial Waiver\nClaim in total dollars (or, if more than one (1) Team submits\nthe highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars, to the Team\nsubmitting the highest Partial Waiver Claim in total dollars\nthat is entitled to the highest order of preference in\naccordance with the waiver procedures set forth in the NBA\nConstitution and By-Laws).\n(v)\nIf there is no Full Waiver Claim or Partial Waiver Claim\nsubmitted for the Contract during the waiver period, the\nContract shall be terminated.\n(vi)\nIn the event that the Contract is awarded to a Team (the\n“Claiming Team”) as the result of a Partial Waiver Claim:\n(A)\nThe Claiming Team shall be responsible for payment\nof the player’s Base Compensation in an amount\nequal to the total dollar amount of the Partial Waiver\nClaim allocated over the Remaining Protected Years\nof the Contract in proportion to the Base\nCompensation amounts provided for in each\nRemaining Protected Year of the Contract (e.g., if the\nplayer has two (2) years remaining on his Contract\nwith $10 million of Base Compensation in year one\nthat is fully protected and $11 million of Base\nCompensation in year two that is fifty percent (50%)\nprotected and the winning Partial Waiver Claim was\nfor $6 million, the Claiming Team shall be\nresponsible for $2.86 million of the player’s Base\nCompensation in year one and $3.14 million in year\n394\nArticle XXII\ntwo) (the “Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation”).\nThe waiving Team shall be\nresponsible for paying the total Base Compensation\nin each Remaining Protected Year of the Contract\nless the Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation for each Remaining Protected Year of\nthe Contract (the “Waiving Team Base\nCompensation Obligation”). In addition to the\nClaiming Team Base Compensation Obligation, the\nClaiming Team shall also be responsible for the total\namount of all other Compensation obligations\ncontained in the Contract other than Base\nCompensation (including, but not limited to, the full\namount of any Incentive Compensation) and the\ntotal Base Compensation for any Remaining\nUnprotected Year.\n(B)\nThe Claiming Team Base Compensation Obligation\nplus any Likely Bonuses applicable to each\nRemaining Protected Year of the Contract and the\ntotal Base Compensation plus any Likely Bonuses of\nany Remaining Unprotected Year shall be included\nin the Team Salary of the Claiming Team\nimmediately upon the awarding of the player to the\nClaiming Team pursuant to this waiver procedure.\n(C)\nThe Claiming Team may not trade a player awarded\nas a result of a Partial Waiver Claim until the July 1\nfollowing the award of the player’s Contract to the\nClaiming Team pursuant to this waiver procedure.\nIf a Claiming Team proposes to trade to another\nTeam a player awarded as a result of a Partial Waiver\nClaim (after the waiting period set forth in the\npreceding sentence) or if the Claiming Team\nsubsequently waives the player and another Team\nproposes to acquire such player in accordance with\nthe NBA waiver procedure, then: (i) for purposes of\ndetermining (a) whether the acquiring Team has\nRoom for the Contract, and (b) in the case of a trade,\nthe amount of any Traded Player Exception in\nArticle XXII\n395\nrespect of such player’s Contract, the player’s Salary\nshall be deemed to equal the Claiming Team Base\nCompensation Obligation plus any Likely Bonuses\napplicable to the then-current Salary Cap Year; and\n(ii) the acquiring Team shall thereafter be deemed\nthe Claiming Team for the purposes of this\nSection 11(i).\n(D)\n(vii)\nThe Claiming Team shall be responsible for making\nall payments to the player (and paying all related\npayroll taxes) other than Compensation due with\nrespect to any Season prior to the waiver. The\nwaiving Team shall reimburse the Claiming Team\nfor the portion of the Waiving Team Base\nCompensation Obligation applicable to each pay\nperiod on or before each applicable pay date.\nIn the event that the Contract is awarded to the Claiming\nTeam as a result of a Partial Waiver Claim and the Claiming\nTeam subsequently waives the player (a “Subsequent\nWaiver”) resulting in the termination of the Contract:\n(A)\nWithout taking into consideration any conditional\nBase Compensation protection triggered after the\ndate of the initial request for waivers but before the\nSubsequent Waiver (hereinafter referred to as\n“Triggered Base Compensation Protection”), if the\nContract contains full Base Compensation\nprotection in each of the Remaining Protected Years\nor if the Contract contains no Remaining Protected\nYears, the Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation and the Waiving Team Base\nCompensation Obligation shall remain unchanged.\n(B)\nWithout taking into consideration any Triggered\nBase Compensation Protection, if the Contract\ncontains partial protection in one (1) or more of the\nRemaining Protected Years, the Claiming Team Base\nCompensation Obligation and Waiving Team Base\nCompensation Obligation for each such year shall be\n396\nArticle XXII\nadjusted as follows upon the termination of the\nContract:\n(C)\n(1)\nThe Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation for any Remaining Protected\nYear that contains only partial Base\nCompensation protection shall be reduced\nby a number equal to the Claiming Team\nBase Compensation Obligation for that year,\ndivided by the total Base Compensation\nobligation for that year, multiplied by the\nunprotected Base Compensation remaining\nto be paid that year (the “Adjusted Claiming\nTeam Base Compensation Obligation”).\n(2)\nThe Waiving Team Base Compensation\nObligation for any Remaining Protected\nYear that contains only partial Base\nCompensation protection shall be reduced\nby a number equal to the Waiving Team\nBase Compensation Obligation for that year,\ndivided by the total Base Compensation\nobligation for that year, multiplied by the\nunprotected Base Compensation remaining\nto be paid for that year.\nThe full amount of any Triggered Base\nCompensation Protection shall be added to the\nAdjusted Claiming Team Base Compensation\nObligation in each remaining year of the Contract\nthat contains Triggered Base Compensation\nProtection.\n(j) The costs associated with the Fitness-to-Play Panels will be borne\nequally by the NBA and the Players Association, and the Players\nAssociation’s share shall be paid by the NBA and included in Player Benefits\nunder Article IV, Section 6(l) of this Agreement.\nArticle XXII\n397\nSection 12. Player Care Survey.\nThe NBA and the Players Association will jointly conduct a confidential\nplayer survey during the 2023-24 Season (and during one or more\nsubsequent Seasons during the term of this Agreement as determined by the\nparties) to solicit the players’ input and opinion regarding the adequacy of\nmedical care provided by their respective medical and training staffs and\ncommission independent analyses of the results of such surveys. The costs\nof such surveys and analyses will be borne equally by the NBA and the\nPlayers Association, and the Players Association’s share shall be paid by the\nNBA and included in Player Benefits under Article IV, Section 6(l) of this\nAgreement.\nSection 13. Wearables.\n(a) The wearables joint advisory committee formed by the NBA and the\nPlayers Association (the “Wearables Committee”) shall continue to review\nand approve wearable devices for use by players. “Wearables” shall mean a\ndevice worn by an individual that measures movement information (such as\ndistance, velocity, acceleration, deceleration, jumps, changes of direction,\nand player load calculated from such information and/or height/weight),\nphysiological information (such as heart rate, heart rate variability, skin\ntemperature, blood oxygen, hydration, lactate, and/or glucose), or other\nhealth, fitness, and performance information.\n(b) The Wearables Committee shall consist of three (3) representatives\nappointed by the NBA and three (3) representatives appointed by the\nPlayers Association. At least one of the members appointed by each of the\nNBA and the Players Association must have at least three (3) years of\nexperience in sports medicine (such as a physician, athletic trainer, strength\nand conditioning coach, or sports scientist) in the NBA or with an NCAA\nDivision I collegiate basketball team (or other relevant experience and\nexpertise as agreed upon by the parties). Unless otherwise agreed by the\nparties, Committee members may not have an ownership or other financial\ninterest in any company that produces or sells any wearable device.\n(c) The Wearables Committee shall be responsible for: (i) reviewing all\nrequests by Teams, the NBA, or the NBPA to approve a wearable device\nfor use by players, with the standard being whether the wearable device\nwould be potentially harmful to anyone (including the player) if used as\nintended, and whether the wearable’s functionality has been validated; and\n398\nArticle XXII\n(ii) setting cybersecurity standards for the storage of data collected from\nWearables.\n(d) The Wearables Committee will jointly retain such experts as it deems\nnecessary in order to conduct its work (e.g., to validate a wearable device or\nto set cybersecurity standards), which the parties expect to include\nprofessionals in areas such as engineering, data science, and cybersecurity.\nThe costs of such experts will be borne equally by the NBA and the Players\nAssociation, and the Players Association’s share shall be paid by the NBA\nand included in Player Benefits under Article IV, Section 6(l) of this\nAgreement.\n(e) No Team may request a player to use any Wearable unless such\ndevice is one of the devices currently in use as set forth in Section 13(f)\nbelow or the device and the Team’s cybersecurity standards have been\napproved by the Committee pursuant to Section 13(c) above.\n(f) Teams may request that, on a voluntary basis, players use the\nfollowing devices: the FirstBeat Sport system; the Catapult Sports\nOptimEye, ClearSky, and Vector systems (including with a Polar chest strap\nbut not with the Catapult heart rate vest); the iMeasureU Step Trident\nsystem; Kinexon Sports systems (including with a Kinexon heart rate vest\npaired with a Polar sensor); the ShotTracker system; the Strive Sense3\nsystems; the WHOOP Performance Strap 2.0; the Zephyr Performance\nSystem; and the Oura Ring (collectively, the “Approved Wearables”).\nWearables (whether Approved or otherwise) may not be used in games. Use\nof any wearable that is not among the Approved Wearables is prohibited.\nIn addition: (i) the only metric categories and/or system variables that\nTeams can use from Approved Wearables are those that were designated as\n“Pass” in the wearables validation reports provided to the parties by their\njointly retained experts; and (ii) Teams must follow the safety directions of\nthe jointly retained experts as provided to Teams in the Wearable Device\nValidation Reports. With respect to raw or unprocessed data exports or\nAPIs from Approved Wearables (“Raw Data”), so long as such Raw Data\nare not provided through a dashboard or other visual within an Approved\nWearable’s software platform, the foregoing shall not prohibit Teams from\n(i) using Raw Data so long as the Raw Data is used in metric categories\nand/or system variables that were designated as “Pass” in the Wearable\nDevice Validation Reports, or (ii) receiving Raw Data. If upon evaluation\nby the Committee, any of the foregoing devices are reviewed and are not\nArticle XXII\n399\napproved by the Committee, Teams will be required to discontinue the use\nof such Wearables.\n(g) A Team may request a player to use in practice (or otherwise not in\na game) on a voluntary basis a Wearable that has been approved by the\nCommittee. A player may decline to use (or discontinue use of) a Wearable\nat any time. Before a Team could request that a player use an approved\nWearable, the Team shall be required to provide the player a written,\nconfidential explanation of: (i) what the device will measure; (ii) what each\nsuch measurement means; and (iii) the benefits to the player in obtaining\nsuch data.\n(h) A player will have full access to all data collected on him from\napproved Wearables. Members of the Team’s staff may also have access to\nsuch data but it can be used only for limited purposes as set forth below.\nData collected from a Wearable worn at the request of a Team may be used\nfor player health and performance purposes and Team on-court tactical and\nstrategic purposes only. The data may not be considered, used, discussed,\nor referenced for any other purpose such as in negotiations regarding a\nfuture Player Contract or other Player Contract transaction (e.g., a trade or\nwaiver) involving the player. In a proceeding brought by the Players\nAssociation under the procedures set forth in Article XXXI, the Grievance\nArbitrator will have authority to impose a fine of up to $250,000 on any\nTeam shown to have violated this provision.\n(i) To advance the shared goal of the NBA and the Players Association\nto promote player health and reduce injuries, and in light of the preference\nof the NBA that game use of Wearables be required, and the preference of\nthe Players Association that Wearables not be required in games and instead\nbe allowed to be worn in games on a voluntary basis only in connection with\nmodified rules regarding commercialization, the NBA and Players\nAssociation will continue to discuss in good faith matters related to the use\nof wearable devices. Pending an agreement between the parties, Wearables\nmay not be used in games, and no player data collected from a Wearable\nworn at the request of a Team may be made available to the public in any\nway or used for any commercial purpose.\n400\nArticle XXII\nSection 14. NBA Draft Combine.\n(a) Each year, the NBA shall organize and operate a Draft Combine\nprior to the NBA Draft. All players invited by the NBA to attend the Draft\nCombine shall be required to attend and participate in the following\ncomponents of the Draft Combine (“Combine Components”):\n(i)\nStrength and agility tests, shooting drills, performance\ntesting, and anthropometric measurements (e.g., height,\nwingspan) (five-on-five scrimmages or any other live action\noffense versus defense drill (e.g., half-court four-on-four or\ntwo-on-one) shall be optional for all players);\n(ii)\nLeague-directed: medical history information, medical\ntesting (e.g., MRIs, echocardiograms, and laboratory tests,\nother than tests for controlled substances), medical\nexaminations, and biomechanical and functional movement\ntesting, including, for clarity, with respect to any of the\nforegoing in this subsection (ii), any medical examination in\naccordance with subsection (d) below and/or follow-up in\naccordance with subsection (e) below;\n(iii)\nMedia circuit;\n(iv)\nPlayer development sessions;\n(v)\nTeam interviews; and\n(vi)\nOther tests and/or assessments.\nThe NBA shall determine and establish the Combine Components\nabove, provided that the performance testing contemplated in the\nforegoing Component (a)(i), the medical testing contemplated in\nthe foregoing Component (a)(ii), and the foregoing\nComponents (a)(iii)-(vi) shall be determined in consultation with\nthe Players Association.\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement to attend and\nparticipate in the Combine Components, any invited player who is physically\nunable to participate in one or more basketball activities (as set forth in\nsubsection (a)(i) above), medical testing or biomechanical or functional\nArticle XXII\n401\nmovement testing (as set forth in subsection (a)(ii) above), or any other tests\nor assessments at the Draft Combine (as set forth in subsection (a)(vi)\nabove) shall be (i) excused from participation in some or all of the applicable\nactivities or tests at the time of the Draft Combine, (ii) required at the Draft\nCombine to complete the Combine Components that he is able to complete,\nand (iii) required subsequently to complete, by no later than the eleventh day\nbefore the Draft, the remaining Combine Components, as reasonably\ndetermined by the NBA unless he remains physically unable to do so. Any\ndetermination with respect to this subsection (b) shall be made by the NBA’s\nmedical director for the Draft Combine, who shall be required to consider\nany opinion timely provided by the player’s treating physician.\n(c) The NBA may excuse an invited player from attending one or more\ndays of the Draft Combine due to a reasonable excuse, as reasonably\ndetermined by the NBA (e.g., family tragedy, birth of a child, playing with a\nFIBA club that is still in season at the time of the Draft Combine). Any\nsuch player may be required subsequently to complete, by no later than the\neleventh day before the Draft, Combine Components as reasonably\ndetermined by the NBA in consultation with the Players Association (e.g., by\nattending an NBA Global Camp or via individual assessments and\nexaminations arranged by the NBA).\n(d) The NBA and Players Association shall agree annually on certain\njointly-selected orthopedic medical specialists with expertise in foot and\nankle, knee, spine, hip, and wrist/hand injuries to attend the Draft Combine,\nconduct medical examinations of particular players at the request of either\nthe player or a Team, and prepare a report for each such player. Subject to\nthe limits on Teams accessing information on certain players in accordance\nwith subsection (g) below, as with other medical history information, testing,\nand examinations from Combine Components, the NBA shall make any\nsuch report(s) from an orthopedic medical specialist available to the player\nand to Teams via the file in respect of the player in the EMR.\n(e) Based on available medical information, including the results of\nmedical testing at the Draft Combine, the NBA may require any player who\nwas invited to the Combine to undergo, by no later than the eleventh day\nbefore the date of the Draft, reasonable and appropriate follow-up testing\nor examination after the Draft Combine, as determined by the NBA’s\nmedical director for the Draft Combine in consultation with the player’s\ntreating physician (if any).\n402\nArticle XXII\n(f) A player shall fail to fulfill his obligation to participate in the Draft\nCombine in respect of a Draft, and shall therefore be ineligible to be selected\nin such Draft in accordance with Article X, Section 9 of the CBA, if he is\ninvited by the NBA to attend the Draft Combine and, as reasonably\ndetermined by the NBA in consultation with the Players Association, fails\nto fully participate in the Combine Components in which the player is\nrequired to participate pursuant to subsections (a)-(e) above.\n(g) The NBA shall organize and operate an annual process that utilizes\nthe following method (the “Top-10 Formula”) for the purpose of\ndeveloping a ranking of the top-10 players eligible in that year’s Draft:\ni.\nThe NBA (after consultation with the Players Association)\nshall annually select no fewer than (a) two (2) publications\nwith publicly-available pre-Draft rankings and (b) two (2)\nindividuals with relevant basketball experience (each such\nindividual, a “Combine Player Ranker”) for the purpose of\ngenerating the composite ranking described below.\nii.\nThe NBA shall utilize (a) from each such publication\nreferenced in subsection (i) above, its publicly-available\npre-Draft rankings, and (b) from each Combine Player\nRanker, his or her ranking of the top-fifteen players eligible\nin that year’s Draft.\niii.\nAny player who is ranked within the top-fifteen by one (1)\npublication and/or Combine Player Ranker, but not ranked\nwithin the top-fifteen by another publication and/or\nCombine Player Ranker shall, for purposes of computing the\nranking of such other publication(s) and/or Combine Player\nRanker(s), be given a ranking of sixteen (16). For clarity,\npursuant to the foregoing sentence, multiple players may be\ngiven such ranking of sixteen (16) for any publication and/or\nCombine Player Ranker that does not rank the player within\nthe top-fifteen (e.g., if two (2) or more players are ranked\nwithin the top-fifteen by one (1) publication and/or\nCombine Player Ranker, but not ranked as such by one (1)\nor more of the other publication(s) and/or Combine Player\nRanker(s)).\nArticle XXII\n403\niv.\nA composite ranking shall be determined by taking, for each\nplayer, the median ranking of each such publication’s\npublicly-available ranking and each such Combine Player\nRanker’s individual ranking provided to the NBA (such\nmedian ranking, the “Combine Player Ranking”).\nv.\nEach player whose Combine Player Ranking equals one of\nthe ten (10) lowest numbers (i.e., where 1 is the lowest\npossible sum that can be generated via the Top-10 Formula\nand thus the highest possible ranking for any player) shall be\nconsidered a top-10 player eligible in that year’s Draft. If\ntwo (2) or more players ranked first through tenth have the\nsame Combine Player Ranking, then the median ranking of\nthe publicly-available rankings from each publication\nreferenced in subsection (g)(i) above shall be used to\ndetermine each such player’s ranking (e.g., if two (2) players\nhave the same Combine Player Ranking, and such Ranking\nis higher than that of five (5) other players, then the player\nwith the lower median ranking of each such publication’s\npublicly-available ranking will be ranked sixth and the player\nwith the higher median ranking will be ranked seventh). If\nstill tied, then each such publication’s publicly-available\nranking and each Combine Player Ranker’s individual\nranking for each such player shall be aggregated, and the\nplayer with the lower total sum will be considered the higherranked player, followed by the player with the higher total\nsum. If still tied, the NBA shall conduct a random drawing\nto determine each such player’s ranking.\nvi.\nIf in any particular year covered by this Agreement the NBA\ndetermines that it is impracticable to calculate one or more\nof the rankings set forth in subsection (g)(i) above (e.g., due\nto the unavailability of a Combine Player Ranker, or if there\nare fewer than two (2) publications whose publicly-available\npre-Draft rankings are determined by the NBA (after\nconsultation with the Players Association) to be suitable for\nthis purpose), the NBA may, after consultation with the\nPlayers Association, generate an output of the Top-10\nFormula using as many of such publication(s)’ and/or\n404\nArticle XXII\nCombine Player Ranker(s)’ individual ranking(s) as is\nreasonably practicable.\nThe NBA shall finalize and provide to the Players Association the\nlist of players eligible in that year’s Draft who are ranked first\nthrough tenth per the Top-10 Formula. The NBA shall finalize such\nlist during the period beginning with the deadline established by the\nNBA under Article X, Section 1(b)(ii)(G) of the CBA to qualify as\nan Early Entry player and prior to the earlier of the date on which\n(x) the NBA conducts a drawing among the Teams that did not\nparticipate in the playoffs in the Season immediately preceding that\nyear’s NBA Draft to determine the order of selection positions in\nsuch NBA Draft, or (y) the on-site process to gather players’ medical\nhistory commences (i.e., the medical intake portion of the medical\nhistory referenced at subsection (a)(ii) above).\nThe information gathered from such players’ Combine Components set\nforth in subsection (a)(ii) above (and (a)(vi) above to the extent that any such\ntest or assessment involves medical information in respect of a player) shall\nbe made available by the NBA after it is gathered: (1) for the player ranked\nfirst, to Teams selecting first through tenth in that year’s Draft; (2) for the\nplayers ranked second through sixth, to Teams selecting first through\nfifteenth in that year’s Draft; (3) for the players ranked seventh through\ntenth, to Teams selecting first through twenty-fifth in that year’s Draft; and\n(4) for all other players invited to the Draft Combine, all Teams.

For clarity, a Team will not have\nviolated this subsection (j)(i) to the extent its discussion\ninvolves only public information regarding a player.\n(ii)\nIf the NBA has reason to believe that the confidentiality\nrestriction set forth in subsection (j)(i) above has been\nviolated, it shall advise the Players Association in a timely\nmanner.\n(iii)\nIf the Players Association determines that the confidentiality\nrestriction set forth in subsection (j)(i) above has been\nviolated, it may bring a proceeding under Article XXXII,\nSection 1 of the CBA before the System Arbitrator. Upon a\nfinding by the System Arbitrator of a material violation, the\nSystem Arbitrator shall have the authority to impose on any\nTeam found to have committed such violation a fine of up\nto $1,000,000. In considering appropriate discipline for a\nviolation, the System Arbitrator shall take into account all\nrelevant factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of\nthe violation on the player, the degree of care demonstrated\nby the Team, and any ill intent regarding the player.\n(k) The NBA will consult with the Players Association in good faith on\n(i) creating a list of non-exclusive jointly-recommended interview questions\nto provide to Teams each year prior to the Draft Combine, and (ii) any issues\nthe Players Association raises relating to scheduling or operational details of\nthe Draft Combine (e.g., setting the dates and location of the Draft Combine,\nelements of the player experience at the Draft Combine).\n(l)\n(i)\nEach player invited to the Draft Combine will be provided\none (1) complimentary first class travel accommodations\n(except when such accommodations are not available) for\nhimself and one family member to the market in which such\nDraft Combine is held, and (2) one (1) complimentary\nindividual room in a group of hotel rooms reserved by the\nNBA for the Draft Combine. One certified agent who\nrepresents each such player participating in the Combine\nArticle XXII\n407\nshall (x) be permitted to reserve one (1) room in such group\nof hotel rooms (at such agent’s expense); and (y) receive an\nNBA credential at the Draft Combine to attend the on-court\nactivities set forth in subsection (a)(i) above; provided that if\nthe Players Association notifies the NBA that a player\nparticipating in the Draft Combine is represented by a\nsecond certified agent who does not already have an NBA\ncredential to attend the on-court activities set forth in\nsubsection (a)(i) above, such second agent shall receive such\ncredential.\n(ii)\nEach player invited to the Draft Combine will be offered an\nNBAGL contract covering the season immediately\nfollowing the Draft Combine. To benefit players, the NBA\nshall also undertake to provide new media opportunities at\nthe Draft Combine for players who attend and participate in\nthe Combine Components.\n(iii)\nMental health and wellness programming, jointly created by\nthe NBA and Players Association for players, will be\nincluded as part of the Pre-Draft Information Program\npresented at the Draft Combine.\n408\nArticle XXIII",

The First Team may require that the player provide the First Team\nwith evidence (such as a copy of the player’s new contract) of the\ncompensation to be earned by the player in connection with his services for\nany Subsequent Team(s).\n(b) For the purposes of this Article XXVII, (i) a “professional basketball\nteam” shall mean any team in any country that pays money or compensation\nof any kind to a basketball player for rendering services to such team (other\nthan a reasonable stipend limited to basic living expenses); and\n(ii) “compensation” earned by a player shall include all forms of\ncompensation (including, without limitation, any non-cash compensation)\nother than benefits comparable to the type of benefits (e.g., medical and\ndental insurance) provided to an NBA player in accordance with Article IV\nabove, travel and moving expenses, and any car and housing provided\ntemporarily by a professional basketball team to the player during the period\nof time for which the player renders services to such team. Notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in this Article XXVII, when a player receives\ncompensation from a non-NBA Subsequent Team on a net-of-tax basis,\nthen for purposes of calculating the amount of set-off to which the NBA\nTeam is entitled pursuant to this Article XXVII, such compensation from\nthe non-NBA Subsequent Team shall be deemed to equal the net-of-tax\ncompensation divided by 0.65 (reflecting a deemed thirty-five percent (35%)\ntax rate); provided, however, that such adjustment to the player’s\ncompensation from the non-NBA Subsequent Team shall not be made, or\nshall be modified accordingly, if the player can establish that taxes in respect\nof the player’s compensation calculated under this provision were not paid,\nor exceed the actual amount paid, by the player’s non-NBA Subsequent\nTeam.\n(c) Without limiting any other rights the First Team has, in the event a\nplayer’s Compensation is reduced pursuant to this Article XXVII and the\nTeam is unable to effect all or a portion of the reduction through payroll\ndeductions, the NBA shall have the right to direct any Subsequent Team\nthat is an NBA Team to withhold any unrecouped amounts from the\nplayer’s Compensation under his new Uniform Player Contract and remit\nsuch amounts to the First Team. To the extent such remedy is insufficient\nto effect a full recoupment of the set-off amount, the NBA and Players\n422\nArticle XXVII\nAssociation shall negotiate in good faith to agree on such supplemental\nmeasures as are appropriate to effect such recoupment.",

The set-off amount\nin respect of each remaining Salary Cap Year under the First Contract in\nwhich the related unearned Base Compensation is stretched in accordance\nwith the mandatory stretch provision shall be allocated such that each of the\nplayer’s stretched protected Compensation payments in respect of the\napplicable Salary Cap Year are reduced on an equal basis over the applicable\nstretch period (i.e., for the first Salary Cap Year with respect to which a\nplayer’s protected Compensation is stretched, over the entire stretch period,\nand for any subsequent Salary Cap Years, over the remaining stretch period).\nIn no event shall a Team be entitled to set-off under a First Contract in\nrespect of compensation earned by a player (for services as a player) from a\nSubsequent Team(s) during a Salary Cap Year occurring after the term of\nthe First Contract.\n(b) In the event the First Team elects to stretch the player’s Salary under\nthe First Contract for Salary Cap purposes in accordance with Article VII,\nSection 7(d)(6) (or had, prior to the effective date of this Agreement, made\nsuch election in accordance with Article VII, Section 7(d)(6) of the 2017\nCBA), then the set-off amount in respect of each remaining Salary Cap Year\ncovered by the term of the First Contract that is stretched for Salary Cap\npurposes in accordance with Article VII, Section 7(d)(6) shall be allocated\nequally to reduce the player’s re-attributed Salary amounts over the\napplicable stretch period in the manner described in Section 5(a) above.\n(c) The following examples are for clarity:\n(X) Assume (i) a player has protected Compensation of $3 million in\nrespect of the 2023-24 Season and is being paid by the First Team at a rate\nof $1 million over three (3) Seasons in accordance with the mandatory\nstretch provision and (ii) the amount of set-off to which the First Team is\nentitled under this Article XXVII with respect to the 2023-24 Season is\n$600,000, then (1) the $600,000 set-off amount would be allocated to each\nof the three (3) Seasons at a rate of $200,000 per Season and (2) the $200,000\nset-off amount for each Season would be deducted in equal installments\nfrom each of the player’s protected Compensation payments each Season.\n(Y) Assume: (i) a player has remaining protected Compensation of\n$9 million ($3 million each for the 2023-24, 2024-25, and 2025-26 Seasons,\nrespectively) under the First Contract; (ii) the First Team requests waivers\non the player on September 5, 2023 and the First Contract is terminated on\n424\nArticle XXVII\nSeptember 7, 2023; (iii) the player later signs a Player Contract with\nSubsequent Team A that provides for a term covering the 2023-24 through\n2024-25 Seasons; and (iv) the set-off amount to which the First Team is\nentitled under this Article XXVII in respect of the player’s Contract with\nSubsequent Team A is $600,000 in respect of the 2023-24 Season and\n$600,000 in respect of the 2024-25 Season. (There is no set-off amount\nunder the First Contract in respect of the 2025-26 Season given these facts\nbecause the term of the Contract with Subsequent Team A does not cover\nthe 2025-26 Season.) Under these facts: (1) with respect to the 2023-24\nSeason, the player’s $3 million of protected Compensation under the First\nContract would be reduced by the applicable $600,000 set-off amount and\nhis reduced protected Compensation amount of $2.4 million would be\npayable in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in the First\nContract; (2) the player’s $6 million of protected Compensation under the\nFirst Contract in respect of the 2024-25 and 2025-26 Seasons would (absent\na right of set-off pursuant to this Article XXVII) be paid by the First Team\nat a rate of $1.2 million per Season over five (5) Seasons in accordance with\nthe mandatory stretch provision; and (3) as a result of the $600,000 set-off\namount to which the First Team is entitled in respect of the 2024-25 Season,\nthe $1.2 million stretched protected Compensation payments described in\n(2) above would each be reduced to $1.08 million (i.e., by $120,000 per\nSeason over the five-Season stretch period covering the 2024-25 through\n2028-29 Seasons).\n(Z) Assume the same facts as in example (Y) above and that on\nOctober 1, 2025, the player signs a Player Contract with Subsequent Team B\ncovering the 2025-26 Season and the set-off amount to which the First\nTeam is entitled under this Article XXVII in respect of such Contract is\n$500,000. In such case, the player’s aggregate then-remaining protected\nCompensation would be further reduced by the additional $500,000 set-off\namount such that the player’s remaining stretched protected Compensation\npayments that would (absent this additional right of set-off pursuant to this\nArticle XXVII) be paid by the First Team at a rate of $1.08 million per\nSeason over the remaining four (4) Seasons of the mandatory stretch period\nwould each be reduced to $955,000 (i.e., by $125,000 per Season over the\nfour-Season remaining stretch period covering the 2025-26 through 2028-29\nSeasons.\nArticle XXVIII\n425",

If the player\nsatisfies the burden and prevails in the proceeding, the sole\nremedy shall be that the player is deemed eligible for the\nApplicable Generally Recognized League Honors.

Such\nwritten notice shall be accompanied by a witness list,\nrelevant documents, and other evidentiary materials on\nwhich the player intends to rely in his affirmative case. No\nlater than 11:59 p.m. eastern on the date following the date\non which the Team received written notice of the Award\nEligibility Grievance, the Team shall provide to the player,\nthe NBA, and the Players Association a witness list, relevant\ndocuments, and other evidentiary materials on which the\nTeam intends to rely in its affirmative case.

The decision of the\nSystem Arbitrator shall constitute full, final, and complete\ndisposition of the dispute and shall be binding upon the\nparties to this Agreement, and the player and Team that are\nparties to the proceeding, and there shall be no appeal to the\nAppeals Panel.\n(ix)\nShould circumstances warrant, each of the deadlines set\nforth in this Section 6(b) may be reasonably modified by\nagreement of the NBA and Players Association.\n(c) Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge.\n(i)\nTo prevail in an Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge in\nrespect of a Season, the player bears the burden of proving\nthat:\n(A)\nDue to extraordinary circumstances, it was\nimpracticable for him to play in one (1) or more of\nthe Regular Season game(s) that he missed during\nsuch Season;\n(B)\nHe would have satisfied the Award Eligibility\nCriterion set forth in Section 6(a)(1) above if he had\nplayed in every game that he missed due to the\nextraordinary circumstances (i.e., assuming that he\nwould have played twenty (20) minutes in each such\nmissed game); and\n(C)\nAs a result of the extraordinary circumstances, and\ntaking into account the totality of the circumstances,\nincluding whether the player did not play in other\nRegular Season games in which he could have played\nduring such Season, it would be unjust to exclude the\nplayer from eligibility for the Applicable Generally\nRecognized League Honors for such Season.\nArticle XXIX\n437\n(ii)\nIf the player satisfies the burden and prevails in the\nproceeding, the sole remedy shall be that the player is\ndeemed eligible for the Applicable Generally Recognized\nLeague Honors.\n(iii)\nExtraordinary Circumstances Challenges shall be heard by\nan independent expert jointly selected by the NBA and\nPlayers Association (the “Challenge Expert”).\n(iv)\nNotwithstanding any of the other provisions of this\nAgreement, the procedures set forth in this Section 6(c) shall\napply to the resolution of Extraordinary Circumstances\nChallenges. If in connection with such disputes, there is any\nconflict between the procedures set forth in this Section 6(c)\nand those set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the\nprocedures set forth in this Section shall control.\n(v)\nAn Extraordinary Circumstances Challenge must be brought\nby a player in respect of a Season no earlier than 12:00 p.m.\neastern time on the last day of the Regular Season and no\nlater than 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the day following the\nlast day of the Regular Season.\n(vi)\nA player may initiate an Extraordinary Circumstances\nChallenge by serving a written notice thereof on the NBA\nand his Team, with a copy of such written notice to be filed\nwith the Challenge Expert and the Players Association. The\nNBA may provide notice thereof to any Team with which\nthe player was under contract during the Season.

No\nlater than 11:59 p.m. eastern on the date following the date\non which the Team received written notice of the\nExtraordinary Circumstances Challenge, the Team shall\nprovide to the player, the NBA, and the Players Association\na witness list, relevant documents, and other evidentiary\nmaterials (if any) on which the Team intends to rely in its\naffirmative case (if any). Absent a showing of good cause,\nneither the player nor the Team may proffer, refer to, or rely\n438\nArticle XXIX\non the testimony of any witness, document, or other\nevidentiary material in its affirmative case that has not been\nidentified as required by this Section 6(c)(vi).\n(vii)\nThe Challenge Expert shall convene a hearing at the earliest\npossible time, but in no event later than two (2) days\nfollowing the Expert’s receipt of notice of the Extraordinary\nCircumstances Challenge. The hearing shall take place by\nvideoconference and shall last no longer than one (1) day.\nThe player, the Players Association, the NBA, and any Team\nfor which the player played during the Season shall have the\nright to participate in the hearing.\n(viii) The Challenge Expert shall render a decision not later than\nthe day following the date of the hearing, and the decision\nshall be accompanied by a written opinion.

If, at any point, any player investment\nor provision of this Section 13 does not comply with applicable laws, then\nthe player shall use best efforts to, and cause the Independent WNBA Team\nto, modify the terms of such investment and/or the parties will negotiate in\ngood faith to modify the terms of this Section 13, in each case, to the extent\nnecessary to fully comply with law and, if such modifications are not or\ncannot be negotiated, then (i) the applicable player investment shall be\ndivested in full and (ii) the applicable terms of this Section 13 shall be\nrendered void and of no further force and effect.\n(c) For purposes of this Section 13, a “player” shall include any person\nor entity controlled by, related to, or acting with authority on behalf of a\nplayer. For clarity, and notwithstanding anything to contrary in this\n446\nArticle XXIX\nSection 13, no agent or representative of a player may invest in a WNBA\nteam.\nSection 14.

If such a Grievance is initiated by the NBA, the\nthirty-day time period referred to in Section 2(c) above shall commence with\nthe date upon which the NBA received the Player Contract (or amendment\nthereto) containing the disputed term or provision. If such a Grievance is\ninitiated by the Players Association, the thirty-day time period referred to in\nSection 2(c) above shall commence with the date upon which the Player\n466\nArticle XXXI\nContract (or amendment thereto) containing the disputed term or provision\nwas first made available for inspection by the Players Association.\n(b) If, as a result of the Grievance and Arbitration procedure, a Player\nContract is found to contain a term or provision that is not permitted by\nthis Agreement, then (i) such term or provision shall be deleted from the\nPlayer Contract and have no force or effect, and the Player Contract shall in\nall other respects remain valid and binding upon the parties thereto, and\n(ii) if the Team and the player agree to reform or revise the Player Contract\nwithin thirty (30) days of the Grievance Arbitrator’s decision, such\nreformation or revision shall be exempted from the rules governing\nRenegotiations contained in Article VII, Section 7(c).\n(c) Nothing set forth above shall affect in any manner the\nCommissioner’s authority with respect to the approval or disapproval of\nPlayer Contracts pursuant to Paragraph 11 of the Uniform Player Contract;\nand the fact that the Commissioner has approved or not disapproved a\nPlayer Contract containing a term or provision not permitted by this\nAgreement shall not be referred to in the course of the Grievance and\nArbitration procedure and shall not be considered in any manner or for any\npurpose by the Grievance Arbitrator in connection with a dispute\nconcerning that Player Contract.\nSection 12. Disputes with Respect to Players Under Contract Who\nWithhold Playing Services.\nIn addition to any other rights a Team may have under contract or law,\nincluding those under Paragraph 9 of a Uniform Player Contract, a Team\nmay recover damages in a proceeding before the Grievance Arbitrator when\na player who is party to a currently effective Player Contract fails or refuses\nto render the services called for under the Player Contract. In any such\nproceeding, where the Grievance Arbitrator determines that damages are\ncontinuing to accrue at the time of the hearing, the Arbitrator shall award\nsuch damages (if any) as the Team has by then sustained, and the hearing\nshall remain open to enable the submission of proof on the issue of\ncontinuing damages.\nArticle XXXI\n467\nSection 13. Expedited Procedure.\n(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a dispute arising\nunder Article XVII, Article XXX, or Article XXXI, Section 12 of this\nAgreement, or under Paragraph 15 of a Uniform Player Contract (but only\ninsofar as such Paragraph provides), or in the event of an alleged breach by\na player of Paragraph 9 of a Uniform Player Contract, the NBA or the\nPlayers Association may request that such dispute or alleged breach be\nreferred immediately to the Grievance Arbitrator. In any such case, the\ndispute or alleged breach shall be asserted by notice in writing given to the\nother party or parties, the NBA, the Players Association, and the Grievance\nArbitrator.\n(b) The Grievance Arbitrator shall convene a hearing with respect to\nsuch dispute or alleged breach at the earliest possible time, but in no event\nlater than twenty-four (24) hours following his receipt of such notice. If the\nGrievance Arbitrator is not immediately available and the parties are unable\nto agree upon another arbitrator to hear and resolve such dispute, the parties\nshall select an arbitrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in\nSection 7(b) above.\n(c) The award, which shall be issued not later than twenty-four (24)\nhours after the conclusion of the hearing, shall be in writing and may be\nissued with or without opinion. If any party desires an opinion, one shall be\nissued but its issuance shall not delay compliance with or enforcement of\nthe award. The award shall constitute full, final, and complete disposition\nof the dispute or alleged breach, and shall be binding upon the player(s) and\nTeam(s) involved and the parties to this Agreement.\n(d) The failure of any party to attend the hearing as scheduled shall not\ndelay the hearing, and the Grievance Arbitrator (or an arbitrator selected in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in Section 7(b) above, as the case\nmay be) shall be authorized to proceed to take evidence and issue an award\nas though such party were present.\nSection 14. Threshold Amount for Certain Grievances.\nA dispute concerning a fine or suspension (or a combination thereof)\nimposed by a Team may be heard and resolved by the Grievance Arbitrator\nonly if it results in a financial impact on the player of more than $5,000. A\ndispute concerning a fine or suspension (or a combination thereof) imposed\n468\nArticle XXXI\nby the Commissioner (or his designee) other than for conduct on the playing\ncourt (as defined in Section 9(c) above) may be heard and resolved by the\nGrievance Arbitrator only if it results in a financial impact on the player of\nmore than $50,000.\nSection 15. Miscellaneous.\n(a) Each of the time limits set forth herein may be extended by mutual\nagreement of the parties involved.\n(b) In any meeting or hearing provided for by this Article XXXI, a\nplayer may be accompanied by a representative of the Players Association\nwho may participate in such meeting or hearing and represent the player. In\nany such meeting or hearing, the NBA and any Team involved may attend\nand be accompanied by a representative who may participate in such\nmeeting or hearing and represent the NBA and any such Team.\n(c) The parties recognize that a player may be subjected to disciplinary\naction for just cause by his Team or by the Commissioner (or his designee).\nTherefore, in Grievances regarding discipline, the issue to be resolved shall\nbe whether there has been just cause for the penalty imposed.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in all proceedings pursuant to Section 9(b)\nabove, the Grievance Arbitrator shall apply an “arbitrary and capricious”\nstandard of review as set forth in that Section.\n(d) Nothing contained herein shall excuse a player from prompt\ncompliance with any discipline imposed upon him. If discipline imposed\nupon a player is determined to be improper by a final disposition under this\nArticle XXXI, the player shall promptly be made whole.\n(e) Nothing contained in this Article XXXI shall be deemed to limit or\nimpair the right of the NBA or any Team to impose discipline upon a\nplayer(s) or to take any other action not inconsistent with the provisions of\na Player Contract or this Agreement.\n(f) Subject to Section 4(c) above, all costs of arbitration, including the\nfees and expenses of the Grievance Arbitrator, and all costs of the\nproceedings before the Player Discipline Arbitrator (including the fees and\nexpenses of the Player Discipline Arbitrator), shall be borne equally by the\nparties thereto; but each party shall bear the cost of its own witnesses,\ncounsel, and the like.\nArticle XXXI\n469\n(g) A Team shall not be required to terminate a Player Contract under\nthe NBA waiver procedure as a condition precedent to the filing of a\nGrievance with respect to such Player Contract. To the extent that the\ndecision of the Impartial Arbitrator in In re: Otis Birdsong, Dec. No. 87-2\n(May 14, 1987) is inconsistent with the foregoing, it is hereby overruled.\n(h) In a proceeding involving the interpretation of a Player Contract, no\nUniform Player Contract (whether signed during the term of this Agreement\nor during the term of any prior collective bargaining agreement between the\nparties), or amendment thereto, other than the Player Contract or\namendment that is the subject of dispute, shall be admissible as evidence of\nthe meaning of, or of the parties’ intentions with respect to, any\nindividually-negotiated terms or provisions in the Player Contract or\namendment that is the subject of dispute.\n470\nArticle XXXII",

Among the factors that may be considered by the NBA and\nArticle XXXIII\n513\nthe Players Association in determining whether to grant reinstatement are\n(without limitation): the circumstances surrounding the player’s dismissal\nand disqualification; whether the player has satisfactorily completed a\ntreatment and rehabilitation program; the player’s conduct since his\ndismissal, including the extent to which the player has since comported\nhimself as a suitable role model for youth; and whether the player is judged\nto possess the requisite qualities of good character and morality.\n(b) For a First-Year Player, the NBA and the Players Association will\nconsider an application for reinstatement only if the player has, in the\nopinion of the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director (as\napplicable), successfully completed any in-patient treatment and/or\naftercare prescribed by the Medical Director or the SPED Medical Director\n(as applicable). For a Veteran Player who was dismissed and disqualified\nunder Section 12(a) above in connection with a Drug of Abuse, the NBA\nand the Players Association will consider any application for reinstatement\nonly if the player can demonstrate, by proof of random urine testing\nacceptable to the Medical Director (conducted on at least a weekly basis),\nthat he has not tested positive (i) for a Drug of Abuse or synthetic\ncannabinoid within the twelve (12) months prior to the submission of his\napplication for reinstatement and during any period while his application is\nbeing reviewed, and (ii) if the Medical Director deems it necessary in his or\nher professional judgment, for marijuana and/or alcohol for the six (6)\nmonths prior to the submission of his application for reinstatement and\nduring any period while his application is being reviewed. For a Veteran\nPlayer who was dismissed and disqualified under Section 12(a) above in\nconnection with a SPED, the NBA and the Players Association will consider\nany application for reinstatement only if the player can demonstrate, by\nproof of random urine and/or blood testing acceptable to the SPED\nMedical Director (conducted on at least a weekly basis), that he has not\ntested positive for a SPED within the twelve (12) months prior to the\nsubmission of his application for reinstatement and during any period while\nhis application is being reviewed.\n(c) The granting of an application for reinstatement may be conditioned\nupon random testing of the player or such other terms as may be agreed\nupon by the NBA and the Players Association, whether or not such terms\nare contemplated by the terms of this Article XXXIII.\n514\nArticle XXXIII\n(d) Any player who has been reinstated pursuant to this Section 13 and\nis subsequently dismissed and disqualified from any association with the\nNBA or any of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a)\nabove shall therefore be ineligible for reinstatement pursuant to this",

Accordingly, such player shall not be a Free Agent\nand shall not be entitled to negotiate or sign a Player Contract with any NBA\nTeam, except as specifically provided in this Section 13.\n(f) (i)\nA First-Year Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this\nSection 13 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement,\nnotify the Team to which he was under contract at the time\nof his dismissal and disqualification (the “previous Team”).\nUpon receipt of such notification, and subject to\nSection 13(f)(ii) below, the previous Team shall then have\nthirty (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with\na stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the\nevent that the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the\nremainder of that Season) and calling for at least the\nMinimum Player Salary then applicable to that player but not\nmore than the Salary provided for in Section 13(f)(iii) below.\nIf the previous Team makes such a Tender, it shall, for a\nperiod of one (1) year from the date of the Tender, be the\nonly NBA Team with which the player may negotiate and\nsign a Player Contract. If the player does not sign a Player\nContract with the previous Team within the year following\nsuch Tender, the player shall thereupon be deemed a\nRestricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of First Refusal. If\nthe previous Team fails to make a Tender, the player shall\nbecome an Unrestricted Free Agent.\n(ii)\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13(f)(i)\nabove, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a\nTender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the\nArticle XXXIII\n515\nnotice required by Section 13(f)(i), he is under contract to a\nprofessional basketball team not in the NBA, or (B) the\nplayer signs a contract with a professional basketball team\nnot in the NBA at any point after the date on which the\nplayer serves the notice required by Section 13(f)(i) and\nbefore the date on which the previous Team makes a\nTender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled\npursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain\ntolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team\nthat he is immediately available to sign and begin rendering\nplaying services under a Player Contract with such Team,\nprovided that such notice will not be effective until the\nplayer is under no contractual or other legal impediment to\nsign with and begin rendering playing services for such team.\n(iii)\nA First-Year Player who is reinstated pursuant to this\nSection 13 may enter into a Player Contract with his previous\nTeam that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for\nthe first Season of up to the Player’s Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he\nwas dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis\nif the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season),\neven if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary\nCap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a\nTeam Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the\nprevious Team enter into such Player Contract and such\nContract covers more than one Season, increases and\ndecreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season\nshall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(a)(1); provided,\nhowever, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed\nand disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale\nContract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the player’s new\nContract may not exceed two (2) Seasons plus two (2)\nOption Years in favor of the Team, and the Salary and\nUnlikely Bonuses called for in any Season of the player’s new\nContract, including any Option Year, may not exceed the\nSalary and Unlikely Bonuses called for during the\ncorresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and\n(B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those\ncontained in the remaining Seasons of the Player’s Rookie\n516\nArticle XXXIII\nScale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified,\nand the Team exercises all Option Year(s) available under\nthe new Contract, then the player’s Team shall retain the\nsame rights with respect to such new Contract as it would\nhave retained under Article XI following the completion of\nthe player’s Rookie Scale Contract.\n(g) (i)\nA Veteran Player who has been reinstated pursuant to this\nSection 13 shall, immediately upon such reinstatement,\nnotify the Team to which he was under contract at the time\nof his dismissal and disqualification (the “previous Team”).\nUpon receipt of such notification, and subject to\nSection 13(g)(iii) below, the previous Team shall then have\nthirty (30) days in which to make a Tender to the player with\na stated term of at least one (1) full NBA Season (or, in the\nevent the Tender is made during a Season, of at least the rest\nof that Season) and calling for a Salary in the first Season\ncovered by the Tender at least equal to the lesser of (A) the\nplayer’s Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which he was\ndismissed and disqualified, or (B) the Estimated Average\nPlayer Salary during the then-current Season, in either case\nreduced on a pro rata basis if the first Season covered by the\nTender is a partial Season, but not greater than the Salary\nprovided in Section 13(g)(iv) below. If the previous Team\nmakes such a Tender, it shall, for a period of one (1) year\nfrom the date of the Tender, be the only NBA Team with\nwhich the player may negotiate and sign a Player Contract.\nIf the player does not sign a Player Contract with the\nprevious Team within the year following such Tender, then\nthe player shall thereupon be deemed a Restricted or an\nUnrestricted Free Agent, in accordance with the provisions\nof Article XI.

For clarity, a Veteran Player who has been\nreinstated pursuant to this Section 13 and would not have\nbeen an Unrestricted Free Agent on the July 1 following his\ndismissal and disqualification (including a Veteran Player\nwho had completed the playing services called for under his\nPlayer Contract with his previous Team at the time of his\ndismissal and disqualification and who would have been a\nRestricted Free Agent on the July 1 following his dismissal\nand disqualification) shall be subject to the process described\nin Section 13(g)(i) above.\n(iii)\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13(g)(i)\nabove, the 30-day period for the previous Team to make a\nTender shall be tolled if (A) on the date the player serves the\nnotice required by Section 13(g)(i), he is under contract to a\nprofessional basketball team or league not in the NBA, or\n(B) the player signs a contract with a professional basketball\nteam or league not in the NBA at any point after the date on\nwhich he serves the notice required by Section 13(g)(i) and\nbefore the date on which the previous Team makes a\nTender. If the 30-day period for making a Tender is tolled\npursuant to the preceding sentence, the period shall remain\ntolled until the date on which the player notifies the Team\nthat he is available to sign a Player Contract with and begin\nrendering playing services for such Team immediately,\nprovided that such notice will not be effective until the\nplayer is under no contractual or other legal impediment to\nsign with and begin rendering playing services for such\nTeam.\n(iv)\nA Veteran Player who is reinstated pursuant to this\nSection 13 and enters into a Player Contract with his\nprevious Team may enter into a Player Contract with such\nTeam that provides for a Salary and Unlikely Bonuses for\nthe first Season of up to the player’s Salary and Unlikely\nBonuses, respectively, for the Salary Cap Year in which he\n518\nArticle XXXIII\nwas dismissed and disqualified (reduced on a pro rata basis\nif the first Season of the new Contract is a partial Season),\neven if the Team has a Team Salary at or above the Salary\nCap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a\nTeam Salary above the Salary Cap. If the player and the\nprevious Team enter into such Player Contract and such\nContract covers more than one (1) Season, increases and\ndecreases in Salary for Seasons following the first Season\nshall be governed by Article VII, Section 5(a)(1); provided,\nhowever, that if the player who is reinstated was dismissed\nand disqualified during the term of his Rookie Scale\nContract, then (A) the number of Seasons in the Player’s\nnew Contract may not exceed the number of Seasons\n(including the Option Year in favor of the Team) that\nremained under the player’s Rookie Scale Contract at the\ntime he was dismissed and disqualified, and the Salary called\nfor in any Season of the Player’s new Contract (including any\nOption Year), may not exceed the Salary called for during\nthe corresponding Season of his Rookie Scale Contract, and\n(B) if the new Contract contains terms identical to those\ncontained in the remaining Seasons of the player’s Rookie\nScale Contract at the time he was dismissed and disqualified,\nand the player’s Team ultimately exercises the Option Year\navailable under the new Contract, then such Team shall\nretain the same rights with respect to such new Contract as\nit would have retained under Article XI following the\ncompletion of the player’s Rookie Scale Contract.\nSection 14. Exclusivity.\n(a) Except as expressly provided in this Article XXXIII, there shall be\nno other screening or testing for Prohibited Substances conducted by the\nNBA or any Team, and no player may undergo such screening or testing;\nprovided, however, that, in a medical emergency, team physicians may test\nplayers solely for diagnostic purposes in order to provide satisfactory\nmedical care. The results of any diagnostic drug testing conducted pursuant\nto the preceding sentence shall not be used for any other purpose by the\nplayer’s Team or the NBA. If any Team is found to have tested a player in\nviolation of this Section 14, the NBA will impose a substantial fine not to\nArticle XXXIII\n519\nexceed $750,000 upon such Team pursuant to the NBA’s Constitution and\nBy-Laws.\n(b) The penalties set forth in this Article XXXIII shall be the exclusive\npenalties to be imposed upon a player for the use, possession, or distribution\nof a Prohibited Substance.\n(c) No Uniform Player Contract entered into after the date hereof shall\ninclude any term or provision that modifies, contradicts, changes, or is\ninconsistent with Paragraph 8 of such Contract (including any condition or\nlimitation on salary protection other than the standard conditions or\nlimitations specifically provided for in Article II, Section 4) or provides for\nthe testing of a player for illegal substances. Any term or provision of a\ncurrently effective Uniform Player Contract that is inconsistent with\nParagraph 8 of such Contract shall be deemed null and void only to the\nextent of the inconsistency.\nSection 15. Random HGH Blood Testing.\n(a) In addition to the testing procedures set forth in Section 5 above, a\nplayer shall be required to undergo HGH Blood Testing at any time, without\nprior notice to the player, no more than two (2) times each Season and no\nmore than one (1) time during each Off-Season. For purposes of this\nSection 15, the last day of a Season for a player shall be the day before that\nplayer’s Off-Season begins. The scheduling of testing and collection of\nblood samples will be conducted according to a random player selection\nprocedure by a third-party organization, and neither the NBA, the Players\nAssociation, any Team, or any player will have any involvement in selecting\nthe players to be tested or will receive prior notice of the testing schedule;\nprovided, however, that it shall not be a violation of the foregoing for the\nthird-party organization (or a specimen collector for the same) to provide\nadvance notice of a scheduled collection to an NBA Team Security\nRepresentative, so long as such notice does not identify the player(s) who\nwill be tested and seeks merely to facilitate access of the collector to the\ntesting location. HGH Blood Testing may also take place under Section 5\n(Reasonable Cause Testing or Hearing) and Section 9 (Steroids and\nPerformance-Enhancing Drugs Program) above, and Section 16 (Additional\nBases for Testing) below. (For clarity, the number of random blood tests\nfor Human Growth Hormone pursuant to this Section 15 shall be in\naddition to the number of random urine tests for other Prohibited\n520\nArticle XXXIII\nSubstances called for in Section 6 above.) HGH Blood Testing may occur\nat the same time that players undergo random urine tests for other SPEDs,\nsubject to the procedures governing game-day blood testing set forth in\nSection 4(b) above and Exhibit I-4 to this Agreement.\n(b) In the event that a player tests positive for a Human Growth\nHormone pursuant to this Section 15, he shall enter the SPED Program and\nsuffer the consequences set forth in Section 9 above.\n(c) The isoform test for HGH blood testing will be used with\ncorresponding decision limits issued by the World Anti-Doping Agency in\nDecember of 2020 (the “WADA Decision Limits”) for positive test results.\n(The WADA Decision Limits are 1.84 for kit 1 and 1.91 for kit 2 for male\nathletes.)\nSection 16. Additional Bases for Testing.\n(a) Any player who seeks treatment outside the Program for a problem\ninvolving a Prohibited Substance, marijuana, or alcohol shall, as directed by\nthe NBA (after notice to the Players Association), submit himself to an\nevaluation by the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as\napplicable) and provide (or cause to be provided) to the Medical Director or\nSPED Medical Director (as applicable) such medical and treatment records\nas the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) may\nrequest. The Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable)\nmay, in his or her professional judgment, also require such a player, without\nprior notice, to submit to testing for Prohibited Substances, provided that\nthe frequency of such testing shall not exceed three (3) times per week and\nthe duration of such testing shall not exceed one (1) year from the date of\nthe player’s initial evaluation by the Medical Director or SPED Medical\nDirector (as applicable).\n(b) Any player who is subject to in-patient or aftercare treatment in the\nProgram and is formally charged with “driving while intoxicated,” “driving\nunder the influence of alcohol,” or any other crime or offense involving\nsuspected alcohol, marijuana, or illegal substance use shall, provided that the\nNBA has advised the Players Association, be required to submit to a urine\ntest, to be conducted by the NBA, within seven (7) days of being so charged.\nArticle XXXIII\n521\n(c) If, pursuant to Section 16(a) above, a player (i) tests positive for a\nDrug of Abuse other than a Benzodiazepine; (ii) tests positive pursuant to\nSection 4(d)(iii), (iv), or (v) above; or (iii) refuses or fails to submit to an\nevaluation or provide (or cause to be provided) the information requested\nby the Medical Director, but does not Come Forward Voluntarily within\nsixty (60) days of being requested to do so by the NBA (with notice to the\nPlayers Association), or if, pursuant to Section 16(b) above, a player tests\npositive for a Drug of Abuse other than a Benzodiazepine, then, in either\ncase the player shall advance two stages in the Drugs of Abuse Program—\ni.e., the player shall enter Stage 2 of the Drugs of Abuse Program (if the\nplayer had not previously entered Stage 1 of such Program), and the player\nshall be dismissed and disqualified from any association with the NBA or\nany of its Teams in accordance with the provisions of Section 12(a) above\n(if the player had previously entered Stage 1 or Stage 2 of such Program).\n(d) If, pursuant to Section 16(a) or (b) above, a player tests positive for\na SPED, Benzodiazepine, or synthetic cannabinoid, he shall suffer the\napplicable consequences set forth in Section 9 or 10 above, as the case may\nbe. If, pursuant to Section 16(a) or (b) above, a player tests positive for a\nDiuretic, he shall be deemed to have tested positive for a SPED and shall\nsuffer the applicable consequences set forth in Section 9 above.\n(e) If a player is or, within the previous six (6) months, (i) has been in\npossession of any device or product used or designed for substituting,\ndiluting, or adulterating a specimen sample, or (ii) has been subject to a\nfinding by another sports league or anti-doping organization that he has\nsubstituted, diluted, or adulterated a specimen sample and that finding has\nnot been overturned on appeal, that player shall be required to undergo\ntesting for Prohibited Substances no more than four (4) times during the\nsix-week period following his notification by the NBA of the\ncommencement of such testing. If the player (i) tests positive for a Drug of\nAbuse other than a Benzodiazepine or (ii) tests positive pursuant to\nSection 4(d)(iii), (iv), or (v) above, he shall be dismissed and disqualified\nfrom any association with the NBA or any of its Teams in accordance with\nthe provisions of Section 12(a) above. If the player tests positive for a\nSPED, Benzodiazepine, or synthetic cannabinoid, he shall suffer the\napplicable consequences set forth in Section 9 or 10 above, as the case may\nbe. If the player tests positive for a Diuretic, he shall be deemed to have\ntested positive for a SPED and shall suffer the applicable consequences set\nforth in Section 9 above. A player who tests positive for a Drug of Abuse\n522\nArticle XXXIII\nor a SPED pursuant to this Section 16(e) may have his dismissal and\ndisqualification or other penalty reduced or rescinded by the Grievance\nArbitrator in accordance with Section 20 below.\n(f) Nothing in this Section 16 shall limit or otherwise affect any of the\nprovisions of Section 5 (Reasonable Cause Testing or Hearing).\nSection 17. Additional Prohibited Substances and Testing Methods.\n(a) Any steroid or performance-enhancing drug that is declared illegal\nduring the term of this Agreement will automatically be added to the list of\nProhibited Substances as a SPED.\n(b) At any time during the term of this Agreement, either the NBA or\nthe Players Association may convene a meeting of the Prohibited Substances\nCommittee to request that a substance or substances be added to the list of\nProhibited Substances set forth on Exhibit I-2 to this Agreement. Any such\naddition of a Prohibited Substance may only include a substance that is or\nis reasonably likely to be harmful to Players and is or is reasonably likely to\nbe improperly performance-enhancing.\nThe determination of the\nCommittee to add to the list of Prohibited Substances shall be made by a\nmajority vote of all five (5) Committee members, and shall be final, binding,\nand unappealable.\n(c) Players will receive notice of any addition to the list of Prohibited\nSubstances six (6) months prior to the date on which such addition becomes\neffective under this Article XXXIII.\n(d) At any time during the term of this Agreement, either the NBA or\nthe Players Association may convene a meeting of the Prohibited Substances\nCommittee to request that a testing method be added to the Program.\nPursuant to this Section 17(d), the Prohibited Substances Committee shall\nhave the authority to: (i) determine what testing methods will be used to\ndetect newly added Prohibited Substances under the Program, if such\nProhibited Substances are detected by methods not currently used by the\nProgram’s laboratories; and (ii) approve the use of new testing methods for\ncurrent Prohibited Substances when such methods have been developed or\nvalidated during the term of this Agreement; provided, however, that the\nProhibited Substances Committee shall not have the authority to add a\ntesting method that would require a change to the manner in which\nArticle XXXIII\n523\nspecimens are collected from players (such as a change from urine\ncollections to blood collections). Any determination of the Committee\npursuant to this Section 17(d) shall be made by a majority vote of all five (5)\nCommittee members, and shall be final, binding, and unappealable.\nSection 18. Prescriptions Under the Anti-Drug Program.\n(a) Notwithstanding the confidentiality provisions of Section 3 of this\nArticle XXXIII, before any player is prescribed a drug or substance (whether\nor not it is a Prohibited Substance) as part of his treatment in the Program,\nthe Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) will notify\nthe designated physician of the player’s team of the name of the drug or\nsubstance (the “Proposed Substance”), the medical justification for the\nprescription of the Proposed Substance, and the name of the prescribing\nphysician.\n(b) If the designated physician of the player’s team advises the Medical\nDirector or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) – at that time or at any\ntime thereafter – that the Proposed Substance would create a possible\nadverse reaction with another prescription substance that the player is being\nadministered, a discussion will be held among the Medical Director or SPED\nMedical Director (as applicable), the prescribing physician, and the\ndesignated team physician with respect to modifying one or both of the\nprescriptions so as to avoid the potential adverse reaction.\n(c) If the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as applicable)\nbecomes aware that a player has been traded to or signed with another team\nafter notification has been made to a designated team physician under\nSection 18(a) above, the Medical Director or SPED Medical Director (as\napplicable) is required to make the same notification to the designated team\nphysician of the player’s new team and to have the discussion required by\nSection 18(b) above.\n(d) A team physician who receives a notification from the Medical\nDirector or SPED Medical Director (as applicable) under this Section 18\nmay only disclose the prescription for the Proposed Substance to other\nmembers of the team medical staff who are required to be advised of the\nprescription in order to ensure that the player is receiving proper medical\ncare from the team’s medical staff, and to no other person.\n524\nArticle XXXIII\nSection 19. Longitudinal Profile for Exogenous Testosterone.\n(a) A longitudinal profile for exogenous testosterone will be established\nfor each player (the “Longitudinal Profile”). The sole purpose of the\nLongitudinal Profile is to assist the laboratory selected by the parties to\nperform the analysis of primary specimens for urine tests under the Program\n(the “Laboratory”) in determining which specimens shall be subjected to\ncarbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry (“IRMS”) analysis.\n(b) Players’ Longitudinal Profiles will be created pursuant to the\nprotocol set forth in Exhibit I-7. The three (3) tests used to create the\nLongitudinal Profiles will be random tests conducted under Section 6 above,\nand the creation of the Longitudinal Profiles will not require any player to\nundergo any testing in addition to the required random testing set forth in\nSection 6 above.\n(c) Once a player’s Longitudinal Profile is established, the director of\nthe Laboratory will consider the player’s Baseline Values (as defined in\nExhibit I-7) in comparison to the normalized Testosterone concentration,\nnormalized Epitestosterone concentration or the corresponding Baseline\nTestosterone/Epitestosterone ratio (collectively, the “Specimen Values”) of\nthe player’s subsequent urine specimens and will determine, in his or her\ndiscretion, whether to conduct an IRMS analysis on a urine specimen. In\naddition, the Laboratory will randomly select urine specimens for IRMS\nanalysis to ensure that such analysis is conducted on at least one (1) urine\nspecimen from every player during each year covered by the Program\n(i.e., from October 1 through September 30). The decision regarding\nwhether to conduct IRMS analysis on a urine specimen for any other reason\nwill remain in the discretion of the director of the Laboratory.\nSection 20. No Significant Fault or Negligence by Player.\n(a) If a player proves by clear and convincing evidence that he bears no\nsignificant fault or negligence for the presence of a Drug of Abuse or a\nSPED in his test result, the Grievance Arbitrator may, in a proceeding\nbrought under Article XXXI of this Agreement, reduce or rescind the\npenalty otherwise applicable under this Article XXXIII. Such reduction or\nrescission (if any) will be determined at the discretion of the Grievance\nArbitrator.\nArticle XXXIII\n525\n(b) For purposes of this Section 20, “no significant fault or negligence”\nmeans the unusual circumstance in which the Player did not know or\nsuspect, and could not reasonably have known or suspected, even with the\nexercise of considerable caution and diligence, that he was taking, ingesting,\napplying, or otherwise using the Drug of Abuse or SPED. To show that he\nbears no significant fault or negligence, the Player must also establish how\nthe Drug of Abuse or SPED entered his system. A Player cannot satisfy his\nburden by merely denying that he intentionally used the Drug of Abuse or\nSPED.\nSection 21. G League Suspensions.\nAny player suspended under the NBAGL anti-drug program who signs\na Uniform Player Contract before the full term of the suspension is served\nshall continue to serve the suspension in the NBA for the lesser of: (i) the\nnumber of games remaining on the suspension imposed under the NBAGL\nanti-drug program when the player signs the Player Contract, or (ii) the\ndifference between the maximum number of games for which the player\ncould have been suspended under the Program for the same violation and\nthe number of games of the suspension already served by the player in the\nNBAGL. In addition, any player suspended under the NBAGL anti-drug\nprogram whose NBAGL contract ends before the full term of the\nsuspension is served shall be subject to Article VI, Section 1(c) of this\nAgreement with respect to the NBAGL suspension if, at the start of the\nfollowing NBA Regular Season, he is a Free Agent who has games remaining\nto be served on the NBAGL suspension. For purposes of Article VI,\nSection 1(c), the “Team to which he was under contract when the\nsuspension was imposed” shall be deemed to be the NBA Team, if any, with\nwhich the player first signs a Player Contract following imposition of the\nNBAGL suspension.\n526\nArticle XXXIV",

Subject to the provisions set forth in\nExhibit 3, if in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player’s injuries\nresulted directly from playing for the Team and render him unfit to play\nskilled basketball, then, so long as such unfitness continues, but in no event\nafter the Player has received his full Base Compensation for the Season in\nwhich the injury was sustained, the Team shall pay to the Player the Base\nCompensation prescribed in Exhibit 1, Exhibit 1A, or Exhibit 1B to this\nContract, as applicable, for such Season. The Team’s obligations hereunder\nshall be reduced by (x) any workers’ compensation benefits, which, to the\nextent permitted by law, the Player hereby assigns to the Team, and (y) any\ninsurance provided for by the Team whether paid or payable to the Player.\n(d) The Player agrees to provide to the Team’s coach, trainer, or\nphysician prompt notice of any injury, illness, or other medical condition\n(including, for clarity, any illness or other medical condition related to\nmental health) suffered by him that is likely to affect adversely the Player’s\nability to render the services required under this Contract, including the time,\nplace, cause, and nature of such injury, illness, or other medical condition.\n(e) Should the Player suffer an injury, illness, or other medical\ncondition, he will submit himself to a medical examination, appropriate\nmedical treatment by a physician designated by the Team, and such\nrehabilitation activities as such physician may specify. Such examination\nwhen made at the request of the Team shall be at its expense, unless made\nnecessary by some act or conduct of the Player contrary to the terms of this\nContract.\nExhibit A\nA-7\n(f) The Player agrees (i) to submit to a physical examination at the\ncommencement and conclusion of each contract year hereunder, and at such\nother times as reasonably determined by the Team to be medically necessary,\nand (ii) at the commencement of this Contract, and upon the request of the\nTeam, to provide a complete prior medical history.\n(g) The Player agrees to supply complete and truthful information in\nconnection with any medical examinations or requests for medical\ninformation authorized by this Contract.\n(h) (i)\nIf the Player consults or is treated by a physician (including\na psychiatrist) or a professional providing non-mental health\nrelated medical services (e.g., chiropractor, physical therapist)\nother than a physician or other professional designated by\nthe Team, the Player shall give timely notice of such\nconsultation or treatment to the Team and shall timely\nprovide the Team with all information it may request\nconcerning any condition that in the judgment of the Team’s\nphysician may affect the Player’s ability to play skilled\nbasketball.\n(ii)\nIf Player engages in two (2) or more training, workout, or\nrehabilitation sessions with a trainer, performance coach,\nstrength and conditioning coach, or any other similar coach\nor trainer other than at the direction of the Team (each a\n“Third-Party Trainer”) during the Season, or five (5) or more\nsuch sessions with a Third-Party Trainer during the\noff-season, he shall give notice of such training, workout, or\nrehabilitation session to the Team prior to the first such\ntraining, workout, or rehabilitation session, provided that:\n(a) during the Season, if the Player does not initially plan to\ncontinue working with any Third-Party Trainer for\ntwo (2) or more sessions, such notice (and certification, if\nrequired pursuant to subsection (iii) below) must be\nprovided no later than prior to the second such session; and\n(b) in the off-season, if the Player does not initially plan to\ncontinue working with any Third-Party Trainer for five (5)\nor more sessions, such notice (and certification, if required\npursuant to subsection (iii) below) must be provided no later\nthan prior to the fifth such session. This notice requirement\nA-8\nExhibit A\nshall not apply to workouts or training that exclusively\ninvolve jogging, road bicycling, swimming, yoga, Pilates,\nand/or dance; and the Player’s failure to comply with such\nnotice requirement shall not itself constitute a material\nbreach of this Contract. For clarity with respect to counting\nmulti-day training or workout sessions under this paragraph,\nany such session(s) shall be counted to equal the number of\ndays on which such training or workouts occurred. Subject\nto the Team’s other rights, and the Player’s other obligations,\nunder the CBA and this Contract, including, for example,\nthe Player’s obligations under this Paragraph 7 to report in\ngood physical condition and to submit to treatment and\nrehabilitation specified by a physician designated by the\nTeam, the Player will have the right in the off-season to work\nout with one or more Third-Party Trainers of his choosing\nand may not be disciplined for exercising that right.\n(iii)\nIf the Player is receiving services from a Third-Party Trainer\nthat are consistent with athletic training and/or strength and\nconditioning services, then in addition to providing notice as\nrequired pursuant to subsection (ii) above, the Player shall\nalso certify to the Team (including by providing supporting\ndocumentation upon request) that such Third-Party Trainer\nmeets the applicable standards for team athletic trainers\nand/or team strength and conditioning coaches set forth in\nArticle XXII, Section 1 of the CBA, provided that this\ncertification requirement in respect of a particular\nThird-Party Trainer shall not apply to the Player if he\nreceived services consistent with athletic training and/or\nstrength and conditioning services from such particular\nThird-Party Trainer prior to the effective date of the CBA.\n(iv)\nIf the Player fails to comply with the notice requirement set\nforth in subsection (ii) above and/or the certification\nrequirement set forth in subsection (iii) above, or if the Team\nwere to determine that a Third-Party Trainer did not meet\nthe applicable standards, the Player may not, unless\napproved by the Team, engage in training, workout, or\nrehabilitation sessions with such Third-Party Trainer.\nExhibit A\nA-9\n(i) If and to the extent necessary to enable or facilitate the disclosure of\nmedical information as provided for by this Contract or Article XXII or\nXXXIII of the CBA, the Player shall execute such individual\nauthorization(s) as may be requested by the NBA, the Team, or the Medical\nDirector or SPED Medical Director of the Anti-Drug Program, or as may\nbe required by health care providers who examine or treat the Player.\n8.\nPROHIBITED SUBSTANCES/DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.\nThe Player acknowledges that this Contract may be terminated in\naccordance with the express provisions of (i) Article XXXIII (Anti-Drug\nProgram) of the CBA or (ii) the Joint NBA/NBPA Policy on Domestic\nViolence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse, and that any such termination\nwill result in the Player’s immediate dismissal and disqualification from any\nemployment by the NBA and any of its Teams. Notwithstanding any terms\nor provisions of this Contract (including any amendments hereto), in the\nevent of such termination, all obligations of the Team, including obligations\nto pay Compensation, shall cease, except the obligation of the Team to pay\nthe Player’s earned Compensation (whether Current or Deferred) to the date\nof termination.\n9.\nUNIQUE SKILLS.\nThe Player represents and agrees that he has extraordinary and unique\nskill and ability as a basketball player, that the services to be rendered by him\nhereunder cannot be replaced or the loss thereof adequately compensated\nfor in money damages, and that any breach by the Player of this Contract\nwill cause irreparable injury to the Team, and to its assignees. Therefore, it\nis agreed that in the event it is alleged by the Team that the Player is playing,\nattempting or threatening to play, or negotiating for the purpose of playing,\nduring the term of this Contract, for any other person, firm, entity, or\norganization, the Team and its assignees (in addition to any other remedies\nthat may be available to them judicially or by way of arbitration) shall have\nthe right to obtain from any court or arbitrator having jurisdiction such\nequitable relief as may be appropriate, including a decree enjoining the Player\nfrom any further such breach of this Contract, and enjoining the Player from\nplaying basketball for any other person, firm, entity, or organization during\nthe term of this Contract. The Player agrees that this right may be enforced\nby the Team or the NBA. In any suit, action, or arbitration proceeding\nbrought to obtain such equitable relief, the Player does hereby waive his\nA-10\nExhibit A\nright, if any, to trial by jury, and does hereby waive his right, if any, to\ninterpose any counterclaim or set-off for any cause whatever.\n10.

Player)\n(Date)\nExhibit F\nF-1\nEXHIBIT F\nJOINT NBA/NBPA POLICY ON DOMESTIC\nVIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND CHILD ABUSE\nThrough this Policy, the National Basketball Association (“NBA”) and\nthe National Basketball Players Association (“NBPA”) (collectively, “the\nParties”) have agreed to work together to address domestic violence, sexual\nassault, and child abuse in the NBA.\nCovered Behavior\nActs that constitute domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse are\nprohibited at all times and regardless of where they occur.\nFor purposes of this Policy, “domestic violence” includes, but is not\nlimited to, any actual or attempted violent act that is committed by one party\nin an intimate or family relationship against another party in that\nrelationship. Such an act may include physical assault or battery, sexual\nassault, stalking, harassment, or other forms of physical or psychological\nabuse. It may also include behavior that intimidates, manipulates,\nhumiliates, isolates, frightens, terrorizes, coerces, threatens, injures, or places\nanother person in fear of bodily harm. Domestic violence can be\nperpetrated by current or former spouses, current or former domestic or\nsame sex partners, persons who are living together or have cohabitated,\npersons with children in common, persons who have or had an intimate or\ndating relationship, and family members. Domestic violence can be a single\nact or a pattern of behavior in a relationship.\nFor purposes of this Policy, “sexual assault” includes, but is not limited\nto, any actual or attempted sexual contact or act to which one party has not\nconsented. Lack of consent is deemed to exist when a person uses or\nthreatens the use of force, harassment, or any other form of coercion against\nanother. Lack of consent is also deemed to exist when a person is mentally\nincapable of giving consent, as a result of disability, incapacitation,\nintoxication, or otherwise.\nFor purposes of this Policy, “child abuse” includes, but is not limited to,\nany act or failure to act by a parent, caregiver, or adult that results in death,\nF-2\nExhibit F\nserious physical or emotional harm, or sexual or other exploitation of a child.\nChild abuse also includes behavior that poses an imminent risk of such harm\nto a child.\nPolicy Committee\nThe Parties shall establish a joint committee to provide education,\nsupport, treatment, referrals, counseling, and other resources for players,\ntheir family members, and others at risk (the “Policy Committee”). The\nPolicy Committee will be comprised of two representatives from the NBA\nand two representatives from the NBPA (the “Party Representatives”), as\nwell as three independent experts with experience in domestic violence,\nsexual assault, and/or child abuse (the “Expert Representatives”). All\ndecisions of the Policy Committee shall be made by a majority vote, unless\notherwise stated in this Policy, and shall be final, binding, and unappealable.\nThe Party Representatives shall jointly select the three Expert\nRepresentatives to serve on the Policy Committee within 60 days of the\nissuance of this Policy. There shall be at least one Expert Representative on\nthe Policy Committee at all times with specific expertise in each of the three\nsubject areas (i.e., domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse). The\nExpert Representatives will each serve for the duration of this Policy;\nprovided, however, that either the NBA or the NBPA may discharge any of\nthem on an annual basis by serving written notice upon the Expert\nRepresentative(s) and upon the other Party within 60 days of the anniversary\nof the appointment of such person. If an Expert Representative is\ndischarged, the Party Representatives shall jointly select a successor Expert\nRepresentative within 30 days of the notice of discharge.\nIn the event that the Party Representatives are unable to agree upon and\njointly select any or all of the Expert Representatives within 60 days of the\nissuance of this Policy or within 30 days of the notice of any discharge of an\nExpert Representative, the following process will be implemented. Within\nfive days following the deadline to select the Expert Representative(s), the\nParty Representatives shall exchange lists containing the names and\nqualifications of three proposed Expert Representatives per open position.\nWithin five days following the exchange of such lists, the Party\nRepresentatives shall jointly select from that group of individuals the Expert\nRepresentative(s) needed to serve on the Policy Committee. If they are\nExhibit F\nF-3\nunable to do so, then, within an additional three-day period, the Party\nRepresentatives shall engage in a process of alternatively striking names\nfrom the lists until one name remains for each open position, and such\nperson(s) shall be appointed as the Expert Representative(s).\nTraining and Education\nThe Parties seek to prevent incidents of domestic violence, sexual assault,\nand child abuse from occurring through educational programs and\nawareness training.\nThe Policy Committee will implement and oversee all training and\neducational programs for NBA players that address issues of domestic\nviolence, sexual assault, and child abuse, and shall make all determinations\nrelated thereto including, but not limited to, the staffing, content, format,\nand frequency of such programs. The Policy Committee will annually\nreview such programs to ensure that they are effective and that the content\nis appropriate, thorough, and properly communicated to the players.\nHotline\nWithin 60 days of the issuance of this Policy, the Parties shall jointly select\na service provider to support a 24-hour, confidential hotline that can be used\nby players, their families, and other victims of domestic violence, sexual\nassault, and child abuse as defined by this Policy to seek assistance and\nreferrals (the “Service Provider”).\nIf the Parties are unable to do so, then, within five days following the\ndeadline to select the Service Provider, they shall exchange lists containing\nthe names, qualifications, and cost of three proposed Service Providers.\nWithin five days following the exchange of such lists, the Parties shall jointly\nselect the Service Provider. If the Parties are unable to do so, then, within\nan additional three-day period, they shall engage in a process of alternatively\nstriking names from the lists until one name remains, and such organization\nshall be appointed as the Service Provider.\nF-4\nExhibit F\nTreatment and Intervention\n1. General\nThe NBA or the NBPA may refer a player to the Policy Committee in\nany of the following circumstances:\na. As part of a disciplinary determination of the Commissioner for\nconduct in violation of this Policy; or\nb. After a Player is criminally convicted of an offense that involves\nconduct in violation of this Policy.\nThe Policy Committee will also be available as a resource to any player\nwho voluntarily seeks assistance.\nOnce a player has been referred to the Policy Committee, an expert\nselected by the Policy Committee will conduct an initial evaluation of the\nplayer as soon as is practicable. Following such evaluation, the Policy\nCommittee will develop a Treatment and Accountability Plan (“TAP”) for\nthe player, as may be appropriate. As part of the TAP, the Policy Committee\nmay require that the player submit to psychological or other evaluations\nand/or attend counseling sessions with a licensed professional, and take\nother steps that it deems necessary. In developing the TAP, the Policy\nCommittee will take into account any treatment or counseling that the player\nmay have initiated on his own or pursuant to a criminal resolution of any\ncharges against him.\nThe Policy Committee will oversee the player’s compliance with any\nTAP, and shall provide additional support to the player as needed. Any\ntreating professionals shall provide regular, written status reports to the\nPolicy Committee that detail the player’s progress and compliance with the\nTAP. The Policy Committee may periodically revise, modify, extend, or\nclose the TAP on its own initiative, on the recommendation of the player’s\ntreating professional(s), or upon petition of the player. All information\nrelated to a player’s involvement with the Policy Committee shall be kept\nconfidential.\nExhibit F\nF-5\nThe Policy Committee shall determine whether the player has\nsuccessfully completed his TAP, and may also issue a revised TAP at any\ntime. A player must receive a certification of completion from the Policy\nCommittee in order to conclude his treatment and the oversight of the\nPolicy Committee.\n2. Non-Compliance\nPlayers are required to comply with the directives of the Policy\nCommittee, including with his TAP. If the Policy Committee determines\nthat a player has failed to comply without a reasonable explanation, it shall\nnotify the NBA. For the first such instance of non-compliance, the NBA\nshall issue a warning to the player. If such non-compliance continues for\nthree additional days after the warning is issued, or for the second or any\nadditional instances of non-compliance as determined by the Policy\nCommittee, the NBA shall fine the player in the amount of $10,000 for each\nday that he fails to comply. Such fines shall continue until the player has, in\nthe judgment of the Policy Committee, resumed full compliance.\nIf the Policy Committee determines that a player has demonstrated\nsubstantial non-compliance, without a reasonable explanation, through a\npattern of behavior that demonstrates a mindful disregard for his treatment\nresponsibilities, it shall notify the NBA, which shall thereupon impose:\na. A one-game suspension for the first instance of substantial\nnon-compliance; and\nb. A suspension that is at least one game longer than his\nimmediately-preceding suspension for each additional instance of\nsubstantial non-compliance and that shall continue until, in the\njudgment of the Policy Committee, the player resumes full\ncompliance with its directives, including with his TAP.\nCosts\nAny and all costs of the training, education, treatment, intervention, and\nother resources described above including, but not limited to, the Policy\nCommittee, Expert Representatives, education and training programs,\nhotline, experts, and counselors, will be shared equally by the Parties (unless\nF-6\nExhibit F\notherwise covered by the NBA Players Group Health Plan or other\ninsurance plan provided to NBA players). The NBPA’s share shall be paid\nby the NBA and included in Player Benefits under Article IV, Section 6 of\nthe CBA. The NBA’s share will be excluded from the calculation of Benefits\nunder the CBA.\nInvestigation of Incidents\nThe NBA will give the NBPA and the player prompt notice of the\ncommencement of any investigation into an alleged violation of this Policy.\nThe NBA’s investigation may include the use of third party resources\nincluding, but not limited to, outside legal counsel, outside investigators, or\nother individuals with relevant experience or expertise.\nThe NBA will notify the NBPA when it has concluded its investigation\nand report whether it believes a violation of the Policy has occurred.\nCooperation\nExcept in circumstances where the player has a reasonable apprehension\nof criminal prosecution, players shall cooperate fully with any NBA\ninvestigation under this Policy. Any player interviewed by the NBA as part\nof its investigation is entitled to have a representative from the NBPA\npresent during the interview, and the NBA will provide the NBPA with at\nleast 48 hours’ notice before any in-person interview.\nFailing to cooperate in full, or interfering in any manner, with an NBA\ninvestigation will subject the non-cooperative individual to discipline\nconsistent with the terms of Article VI, Section 11(a) of the CBA. It may\nconstitute a violation of this cooperation requirement for a player to attempt\nto or enter into any agreement with a witness, victim, or other party that\nwould discourage or prevent that individual from cooperating with an NBA\ninvestigation. However, the player is under no obligation to demand,\nrequest, or otherwise encourage anyone to cooperate with an NBA\ninvestigation.\nExhibit F\nF-7\nAdministrative Leave\nWhile an investigation is pending, the Commissioner may at any time\nplace the player on administrative leave with pay for a reasonable period of\ntime. The parties agree that administrative leave is not intended to be\nroutinely applied during the pendency of every player investigation under\nthis Policy. Instead, administrative leave should be applied in only those\ncases in which a balancing of all relevant factors clearly establishes that it is\nreasonable to do so under the totality of the circumstances.\nIn deciding whether to place a player on paid administrative leave, the\nCommissioner shall consider among other relevant factors the following\nnon-exhaustive list of factors:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nThe nature and severity of the allegation(s), including whether a\nweapon was involved and whether any injury was suffered by anyone\n(including the player);\nWhether the allegations are supported by credible information;\nThe relationship between the player and accuser;\nInformation regarding the player’s history of prior similar conduct,\nor lack thereof;\nThe prior criminal or disciplinary history of the player, or lack\nthereof;\nThe status of any criminal investigation and/or prosecution\nregarding the alleged incident, including whether any arrests have\nbeen made;\nThe character of the player;\nThe player’s reputation within the NBA community;\nThe NBA’s past practice regarding discipline imposed on a player\nfor similar allegations; and\nThe risk of reputational damage to the NBA and/or the player’s\nteam.\nThe NBA will give prompt notice to the NBPA, the player’s team, and\nthe player of any decision to place a player on paid administrative leave\npursuant to this Policy. The decision to place the player on paid\nadministrative leave pending an investigation shall not preclude further\nF-8\nExhibit F\ndisciplinary action by the Commissioner against the player in accordance\nwith the provisions of this Policy.\nWhile on administrative leave, the player shall be ineligible to play in any\nof his team’s games. However, the player will continue to receive his salary\nand other welfare benefits to which he would be entitled as an active player.\nThe player and the player’s team may also request that the player be allowed\nto participate in non-public practices, workouts, or other team activities with\nthe consent of the NBA, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.\nA player may challenge the decision to be placed on paid administrative\nleave under the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure of the CBA. In\nevaluating such a challenge, the Grievance Arbitrator will determine whether\nit was reasonable for the Commissioner to place the player on administrative\nleave. A player may also request the Grievance Arbitrator review the length\nof a period of administrative leave that exceeds seven days. In such a\nproceeding, the Grievance Arbitrator will determine whether administrative\nleave in excess of seven days is reasonable based on the totality of the\ncircumstances. Once a player challenges the decision to be placed on paid\nadministrative leave, or the duration of such leave, the hearing before the\nGrievance Arbitrator must take place within 72 hours.\nDiscipline\nBased on a finding of just cause, the Commissioner may fine, suspend,\nor dismiss and disqualify from any further association with the NBA and its\nteams a player who engages in prohibited conduct in violation of this Policy.\nRepeat offenders will be subject to enhanced discipline.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, an admission to, or conviction for, any\noffense that involves conduct that violates this Policy, whether after trial or\nupon a plea of guilty, as well as any plea of no contest or nolo contendere,\nwill conclusively establish a violation of this Policy. A violation based on\nthis ground, however, shall in no way limit or prevent the NBA from\ncontinuing to investigate the incident. Additionally, such admission,\nconviction, or plea is not required in order for a Policy violation to have\noccurred. However, a player who is acquitted after trial in a criminal\nproceeding may not be subject to disciplinary penalties under this Policy.\nExhibit F\nF-9\nIn conjunction with any discipline imposed by the Commissioner for a\nviolation of this Policy, the NBA may also require the player to undergo an\nevaluation under the supervision of the Policy Committee, to participate in\nrelevant training, education, or counseling programs as determined by the\nPolicy Committee, and/or to perform community service. Any discipline\ndetermined by the Commissioner may be referred to the player’s team for\nimposition.\nPrior to the determination of any discipline, the Parties shall meet to\ndiscuss the matter. This conference shall be considered confidential, and no\nstatements made during the discussion shall be admissible in any subsequent\nchallenge to any discipline imposed on the player.\nThe Commissioner will determine all discipline under this Policy on a\ncase-by-case basis, upon consideration of all facts and circumstances,\nincluding aggravating and mitigating factors.\nPotential aggravating factors include, but are not limited to:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nPrior allegations of, or convictions for, prohibited conduct;\nThe use of a weapon or other means of coercion;\nThe use of, or threat to use, force or violence;\nThe vulnerability of the victim;\nThe presence of a minor;\nThe nature and extent of any injury to the victim; and\nA civil verdict against the player for the underlying conduct.\nPotential mitigating factors include, but are not limited to:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nAcceptance of responsibility;\nEvidence of self-defense;\nComplete and truthful cooperation with the investigation;\nVoluntary participation in any treatment or counseling programs;\nThe player’s overall good character;\nThe player’s reputation in the NBA community; and\nA civil verdict in favor of the player for the underlying conduct.\nF-10\nExhibit F\nIn cases where the Commissioner imposes a suspension, any period of\ntime the player spent on paid administrative leave will be credited toward\nthe suspension provided that the player remits to the League the applicable\nportion of salary that the player received while on paid administrative leave.\nChallenges to any disciplinary action shall be made through the Grievance\nArbitration process of the CBA.\nConfidentiality\nThe Parties recognize the importance of confidentiality and privacy to\nthe success of this Policy. Accordingly, the Parties will maintain\nconfidentiality throughout the investigatory, disciplinary, and treatment\nprocess, and will take reasonable measures to protect the information\ngathered pursuant to this Policy, including by any outside advisors or\nexperts. Any medical information obtained during the investigatory,\ndisciplinary, and treatment process will be kept confidential as required by\napplicable law.\nAt the same time, the Parties recognize that disclosure of certain\ninformation may be necessary to further the NBA’s investigation or may be\nrequired by law, including by court order or subpoena. Accordingly, the\nParties cannot and do not guarantee that complete confidentiality will be\nmaintained. The Parties also reserve the right to make notifications to law\nenforcement or other appropriate authorities if either the NBA or the\nNBPA becomes aware that there is a threat of imminent harm to any\nindividual or in cases where the victim is a child or is either mentally or\nphysically incapacitated. Additionally, in matters where a violation is found\nand discipline is imposed, such findings and discipline may be the subject of\npublic statements by the NBA and/or the NBPA.\nRetaliation\nUnder this Policy, it is prohibited to retaliate, or threaten to retaliate,\nagainst any individual who, in good faith, reports a potential violation of this\nPolicy or who honestly participates in an investigation of such a report. It\ndoes not matter whether the investigation establishes that a violation of the\nPolicy occurred, as long as the report of the violation or participation in the\ninvestigation is in good faith. Such retaliation includes, but is not limited to,\nExhibit F\nF-11\nthreats, intimidation, harassment, and any adverse employment or other\naction, whether express or implied. Anyone who retaliates, or threatens to\nretaliate, against an individual who reports, or participates in an investigation\ninto, an alleged violation of this Policy, or against any victim or other\nwitness, will be subject to independent disciplinary action.\nAs with any complaint brought in bad faith, any individual, including\ncoaches, general managers, or other team officials, who reports a violation\nof this Policy knowing such claim is malicious, false, or fundamentally\nfrivolous shall be subject to disciplinary action.\nReporting\nAnyone who is the victim of or acting on behalf of a victim of domestic\nviolence, sexual assault, or child abuse, as defined by this Policy, is strongly\nencouraged to call the hotline established under this Policy as soon as\npossible after the incident to discuss the availability of counseling, treatment,\nsecurity, and other appropriate resources.\nIf you are in immediate danger or involved in a situation in which another\nperson is in immediate danger, the Parties recommend that you contact 911\nor your local police department.

For random drug testing of a visiting team scheduled\nat game-day shoot-arounds, tests will be scheduled to occur before the\nshoot-around for that team commences, and for any tests that are not\ncompleted by the time the visiting team bus is scheduled to leave the arena\nor practice facility after the shoot-around is completed, the team will provide\nalternate transportation to the team hotel for any player that must remain at\nthe arena or practice facility to complete the testing process and will ensure\nthat a Team staff member remains with the affected player(s) and\naccompanies him or them back to the Team’s hotel. Random drug tests can\nbe scheduled to occur at any time during the Off-Season.\nWhen the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure that\nthe player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or\nidentification by a team representative. If the player’s identity cannot be\nestablished, the collector shall not proceed with the collection.\nThe player will be asked to select a sealed urine specimen cup. The player\nwill then provide his urine specimen under the direct observation of the\ncollector.\nThe collector shall ensure that the player has provided a urine specimen\nof sufficient volume for accurate testing. If such a sample cannot\nimmediately be provided by the player, he shall be instructed to remain at\nthe testing site for a reasonable period of time until he can provide such a\nspecimen. Once the specimen has been obtained, the player will select a\nsealed specimen kit, which contains two bottles. The collector, in the\npresence of the player, will pour the specimen into two bottles. One bottle\nwill be used as the primary or “A” specimen and the other will be used as\nthe split or “B” specimen. The specimen bottles will be sealed with\ntamper-proof seals in the presence of the player. The seals will contain a\nunique identification number that corresponds to the number on the chain\nof custody form.\nI-3-2\nExhibit I-3\nThe player and collector will complete the chain of custody form (which\nmay be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the handling of the\nspecimen. The collector will note any irregularities concerning the specimen\non the chain of custody form. Both the player and collector will sign the\nchain of custody form. The kit will be sealed and sent via an overnight\ndelivery service to the laboratory for testing. If a hard copy chain-of-custody\nform is used, it will be included in the kit containing the two specimens that\nis sent by overnight delivery service to the laboratory. If an electronic\nchain-of-custody form is used, it will be sent to the laboratory electronically.\nOnce the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will\nbe analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive or produces an atypical\nfinding, the split sample will be placed in frozen storage and will be available\nfor testing by a different laboratory, if directed by the NBA.\nExhibit I-4\nI-4-1\nEXHIBIT I-4\nBLOOD COLLECTION PROCEDURES\nDuring the Season, collections for random testing will be scheduled to\noccur after practices on non-game days, and after games on game days.\nRandom tests can be scheduled to occur at any time during the Off-Season.\nWhen the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure that\nthe player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or\nidentification by a team representative. If the player’s identity cannot be\nestablished, the collector shall not proceed with the collection.\nThe player will be asked to select one (1) dried blood spot collection kit\nand one (1) security kit that will be used to transport the specimen.\nThe collector shall collect a total of four (4) blood spots. The player’s\nnon-dominant arm will be used to make the initial blood draw attempt. If\nthe blood draw is not possible or successful from the non-dominant arm,\nthe dominant arm may be used. In the event that the collector determines\nthat there is no suitable location on the dominant or non-dominant arm due\nto excessive hair or heavy tattoo ink, the player’s thigh may be used as an\nalternate draw site. No more than three (3) attempts will be made to draw\na blood specimen. After that, the collection will be discontinued. Upon\ncompleting the blood draw, the collector will ensure that the draw site is not\nbleeding and bandage the site.\nThe player and collector will complete the chain of custody form (which\nmay be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the handling of the\nspecimens. Both the player and collector will sign the chain of custody form.\nThe specimen will be sealed in a blood specimen bag and sent via an\novernight delivery service to the laboratory for testing. If a hard copy\nchain-of-custody form is used, it will be included in the kit containing the\ntwo specimens that is sent by overnight delivery service to the laboratory.\nIf an electronic chain-of-custody form is used, it will be sent to the\nlaboratory electronically.\nI-4-2\nExhibit I-4\nOnce the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will\nbe analyzed.
