## Next: Customize Fonts & Colors

Now that the page is clean, you wanted to customize the fonts and colors inside Study Mode. 

**What would you like to change?**
1. Font style (bolder, different font family?)
2. Colors of the cards/pools/buttons?
3. Size of text?
4. Something else?

**Tell me specifically what you'd like and I'll make it happen!** 🎨
